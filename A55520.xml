            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have not uttered it haſtily &amp; unadviſedly, but upon mature, or at the leaſt upon long deliberation, and divers yeeres have now paſſed, ſince ſome chiefe ſubſtantiall points of it, were publiquely declared and defended in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity ſchoole at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and neither then, nor at any time ſince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could I ever heare, or learne any reaſon that could be brought againſt it, which might cauſe me to doubt of the probability or truth of it. Nevertheleſſe if any man either by authority of ſcripture, or evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhall be able to confute and evince, the poſſibility or probability of this <hi>interpretation,</hi> or of any ſubſtantiall

            <p>Concerning the interpretation itſelfe, it ſuppoſeth this number 666. to be an image and typicall repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole body of
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> that is, of the whole body of his Kingdome, ſtate and Hierarchy: and thus much is generally acknowledged by many writers, and eſpecially by <hi>Cotterius,</hi> who layeth this as a certaine ground, by which the true interpretation of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ought to be tried and examined. Now if this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be an Image and type of the whole body of
<hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> then no man ought to imagine that the whole image of
<hi>Antichrist,</hi> is like unto any one particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or part of the body of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> for as the whole image of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is not like unto the hand of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor like unto the head of
<hi>Caeſar;</hi> ſo neither is this number being conſidered wholly, applicable to any particular Times, Names, Perſons, Places, or other individuall things or circumſtances belonging unto <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters have endeavoured to apply it. But he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to know <hi>Caeſar</hi> by his image, muſt compare head to head, face to face, eye to eye, hand to hand, and foot
<pb facs="tcp:108880:5"/> to foot, and ſo conclud a likeneſſe in generall from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particulars. In like manner he that deſires to know Antichriſt by this number, muſt firſt finde in this number (being conſidered as an abſolute number) ſuch things as are moſt eſſentiall and remarkable in it, and ſuch things by which this number is diſtinguiſhed from all other numbers, and theſe things being found out, muſt be compared, with thoſe things that are moſt eſſentiall and remarkable in that ſtate or government which is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and with thoſe things, by which <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from all other ſtates and governments what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Now the Root and Figure of every number, are thoſe things which are moſt eſſentiall and remarkable in it; and by one or both of theſe, every number is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all other numbers, in theſe doe the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all properties of all numbers conſiſt, and upon theſe chiefly doe all thoſe myſteries depend, which S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> and divers other ſacred and profane writers have obſerved to be in numbers.</p>
            <p>And concerning thoſe things which are moſt eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and remarkeable in the Kingdome of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> to, and with which, the Root and figure of this number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found out, is to be applied and compared; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves doe infallibly guide and direct unto them, by an actuall application, of the Root and figure of an oppoſite number, unto ſuch particulars, as are moſt remarkably anſwerable and oppoſite unto them. As for the finding out of the Root, and Figure of the number 666. This cannot be done, but by a kinde of calculation or computation of the number itſelfe; wherefore it is ſaid in the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Let him that hath underſtanding count the number of the Beaſt, that ſo he may finde out the Root and Figure of it, by which the root and foundation of
<hi>Antichriſts Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:108880:6"/> his originall, his City ſtate, doctrine, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars are manifeſtly revealed; And this is the effect of the following interpretation, which dependeth chiefly upon the extraction of the root of the number 666, as the words of the Text doe neceſſarily imply, that the right interpretation ſhould doe; and I am ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that this is the true manner of counting the Beaſts number, that I will be bold (with addition of two words onely) to ſay in theſe times of this computation in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as <hi>Cotterius</hi> in the time of King <hi>Iames,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his typicall interpretation in generall.

                  <hi>CAP. 2.</hi> That the myſtery of the number 144, which is the number oppoſed to 666, conſiſts in the ſquare root of it, which is 12; and that therefore the myſtery of 666 muſt be in the ſquare root of it alſo.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now concerning the manner how this number 144 ought to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is already agreed upon, as it were, by a general conſent as well of the ancient as of the later interpreters, that the only, or at leaſt, the chief cauſe why this number was choſen rather then any other to be the meaſure of the wall of the celeſtiall Jeruſalem, is, becauſe this number is raiſed, and built upon the number 12, which being multiplied into it ſelfe, produceth this ſquare number 144. For as this number 144 is raiſed and built upon the number of 12 onely, and cannot poſsibly admit of any other number to be the root and <hi>baſis</hi> of it (as is evidently knowne to all that have skill in Arithmetick to count numbers, and extract the roots of them) ſo neither can the Church of Chriſt admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other foundation then that which is already laid by the 12 Apoſtles. As therefore this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 144 is built upon 12 unities, ſo is the Church
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108880:13"/> of Chriſt upon the 12 Apoſtles. And as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 12 is more conſpicuous and remarkable in this number 144, then any other number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it meaſureth not onely the bottome or root, but the ſides and rankes of it alſo, as will plainly appeare to any one that conſidereth and counteth the ſides and unities of this ſquare fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure following, where the number 144 is ſet down in due order, the unities being placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to right angles and equall diſtances one from another.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108880:13"/>I ſay therefore, as the number of 12 is more conſpicuous and remarkeable in this figurated number conſiſting of 144 vnities, then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther number: ſoe it is evident, that the number of 12 is more conſpicuous and remarkeable in the Church of God, then any other number whatſoever. And hence it is that this number 12 is rehearſed and repeated above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty and foure times in the Scriptures, and is in them ſo often uſed, and in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo diverſe particulars applied by the ſpirit to things pertaining to the Church, that we cannot but acknowledge this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be choſen, and as it were affected by the Holy Ghoſt rather then any other. And although the number 144, may truly bee ſaid to be Gods number in a more particular manner, then many other numbers uſed in the Scriptures, becauſe it repreſenteth the figure of the Citty, and in generall, the forme and ſtructure of the Church, and Hierarchie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (as ſhall be ſhewed) yet it cannot ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called Gods number, as the number 12, which almoſt in all materiall reſpects is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Church, and is uſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alwaies, as <hi>numerus certus pro certo,</hi> and not as <hi>numerus certus proincerto:</hi> in which ſenſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108880:14"/> it muſt needs be granted that the number
144 doth ſignify and repreſent the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. For, it is not, in it ſelfe, being wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, applicable, as the number 12 is, to any particular times, perſons, or places, or other particular things, mentioned in the Scriptures; but only in reſpect of the root or <hi>baſis</hi> of it, which is 12. For there were 12 Tribes, not 144; and 12 gates in Jeruſalem, not 144; and 12 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, not 144. And ſo it may be ſaid of many other things. And, whereas the number 144 is no where mentioned in the Scriptures, but only in the 21 of the Revelation, it muſt needs be granted, that it is not there ſaid to be the meaſure of the Wall (which doth in that place ſignify the ſpirituall building of Gods Church) becauſe there then were, or, at any time ſhould be preciſely ſo many, &amp; no more faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or living ſtones built upon the 12 foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations there named; but that we might thence learne, that how great or how little ſoever the number of faithfull Chriſtians ſhould be, yet they muſt be all built upon the foundation of the 12 Apoſtles, as the number 144 is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 12 unities. And hence, that is evident, which moſt interpreters grant, that this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 144 was choſen to be the meaſure of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108880:14"/> wall of the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for this reaſon only, or for this reaſon chiefly, becauſe it is the only ſquare number which can be raiſed and built upon 12 unities, as is clearly known to all thoſe that haue underſtanding to extract the roots of numbers.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108880:15"/> applicable to the kingdome of Antichriſt; and that, as the number 12, which is the ſquare root of 144, is more properly ſaid to be Gods num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then the number 144, becauſe it is a number which God would have conſpicuous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in the founding of his Church, and divers other reſpects, both above that and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther numbers: ſo in like manner that number which is the ſquare root of the number 666, muſt more properly belong to Antichriſt, then the number 666, as a number which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt would have conſpicuous &amp; remarkable both in the founding of his Kingdome, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in divers other reſpects, above any other number whatſoever: although, I ſay, I might proceed to proſecute theſe grounds already laid, and taken for granted by learned interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to ſhew what number is the root of the number 666, and how it doth accurately and eſſentially deſcribe, and characterize the Citty, State, and Hierarchie of Antichriſt; yet leaſt J might ſeem to ſome to build that, which I am fully perſwaded and reſolved to be a certaine &amp; infallible truth, upon weake &amp; unſure grounds; I will therefore yet farther cleare the manner of this interpretation, before J touch the truth of its application.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words of the Text, in which theſe meaſures of the City and Wall are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, are theſe which follow in the 21 of the Revelation.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>16. <hi>And the City lyeth foure ſquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the City with the reed, twelve thouſand furlongs: the length, and the breadth, and the heighth of it are equall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. <hi>And he meaſured the wall thereof, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty and foure Cubits, according to the meaſure of a man, that is, of the Angell.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Firſt, it is to be conſidered, that the furlongs and cubits, here uſed by the Angell, are, in the laſt words, ſaid to be the meaſure of a man. Wherefore it is diligently to be conſidered, and enquired, how many kindes of meaſuring by furlongs and cubits are uſed by men. For, there can no other cauſe be imagined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why theſe words, <hi>menſura hominis quae eſt angeli,</hi> ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108880:17"/> have been added, but that they ſhould be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former, and as it were an anſwer to ſuch doubts and objections as might ariſe from them. It is likely therefore that the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of theſe words, will be as a key to open all that is ſpoken concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures above named. Now, if it had been ſaid, the cubits are the cubits of a man; or, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs are the furlongs of a man; then it had been probable that theſe words were added, leſt the juſt length of the furlongs or cubits ſhould have been miſtaken; but foraſmuch as it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is the Meaſure of a man which the Angell uſeth. The words ſeem to intimate, that the danger of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking lieth rather in miſunderſtanding the manner of meaſuring by furlongs and cubits, then in miſtaking the true length of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are named. And if ſo; then that manner of meaſuring which is here meant, is not that which is moſt commonly uſed among men, or in the ſcriptures. For then there had been no danger of miſtaking it, or cauſe why this expoſition ſhould have been added. It ſeems therefore, that, this kinde of meaſuring by furlongs and cubits, which the Angell doth in this place uſe, doth properly belong to a man;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108880:17"/> and yet ſo, that it is not that kinde of meaſuring which is moſt commonly and moſt ordinarily uſed, either by men, or in the ſcriptures. And now to finde out, what this not ſo uſuall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though moſt proper kinde of meaſuring is; it is diligently to be enquired, how many kindes of meaſuring by furlongs, or cubits, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch like meaſures, are at all vſed among men. And upon this inquirie there are three kindes of meaſures, and three only, which will offer themſelves to our conſideration. For as there are onely three ſeverall kindes of quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are commonly called, <hi>linea, ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, &amp; corpus,</hi> that is, Length, Breadth, and Thickneſſe: ſo there are three kindes of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, uſed by men, which are properly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to theſe three kindes of quantities, and are called Lineall meaſure, Square meaſure, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid meaſure; and without theſe meaſures, the quantities above named, can neither be truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed nor rightly underſtood.</p>
               <p>And now, being there are but theſe three waies by which a man may meaſure ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid figure as this City is here deſcribed to be, it muſt needs be granted, that this meaſure of 12000 furlongs, is either the Lineall, or the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial, or the Solid meaſure of this Citie: and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108880:18"/> if that meaſure of theſe three, which is moſt commonly uſed among men and in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, muſt be rejected in this place, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above ſaid, then in all probability Lineal meaſure, the firſt of theſe three above named, which is far more commonly uſed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and among men then either of the other, muſt not be underſtood in this place; and ſo by conſequence theſe 12000 furlongs can neither be the meaſure of one of the ſides of this Citie, nor of the compaſſe of it.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing that the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh properly, in ſetting downe the meaſures of this Citie, and after the manner of men, (as the words of the text laſt above recited doe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and evince) it is no hard matter, even by the words themſelves to determine, not onely which of theſe three meaſures is not, but which of them is, here to be underſtood. For firſt, it is diligently to be conſidered, what kind of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie that is, which is here ſaid to be meaſured by the Angell. And ſecondly, it is accuratly to be obſerved, that the meaſure of 12000 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, is not here ſaid to be the meaſure of the Length, nor of the Breadth, nor of the compaſſe, nor of the ground-plat or <hi>Area,</hi> nor of the ſides of the Citie; but only of the Citie it ſelfe, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108880:18"/> is here ſet downe plainly to be a ſolid Cubicall figure, containing three dimenſions. This mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therefore of
12000 furlongs, is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a ſolid Cubicall figure, and therefore in proprietie of ſpeech, and according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, it muſt of neceſſity be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be a ſolid meaſure. If the meaſure of the length, or of the breadth, or of the compaſſe of this Citie, had been ſaid to have been 12000 furlongs, then who would, or who could have underſtood it of any other meaſure but lineall meaſure onely? ſo likewiſe being the Citie it ſelfe is ſaid to be meaſured 12000 furlongs, or as the Rhemiſts tranſlation hath it, <hi>for twelve thouſand furlongs;</hi> who will, or who can, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally according to the manner of men, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaſure of a ſolid figure to be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a ſolid meaſure? And although it may ſeeme unprobable, that an Angell ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the magnitude of this Citie, by a phraſe and a meaſure borrowed rather from the ſchooles of geometry (which hath taught men to meaſure plaine and ſolid figures with ſquare and ſolid meaſures) then from the book of the Scriptures, wherein this kind of meaſuring is ſeldome or obſcurely uſed; yet for this very cauſe, is this interpretation the rather to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108880:19"/> For the holy Ghoſt would never have vouchſafed to have anſwered this objection ſo appoſitely by theſe words following, <hi>menſura hominis quae eſt Angeli,</hi> except humane reaſon might with probability have urged it.</p>
               <p>From the words of the text therefore, and from that manner of meaſuring which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs to men, and is commonly uſed by them, it followeth that the meaſure of 12000 furlongs here named, muſt needs be underſtood of ſolid furlongs, there being no other manner of meaſuring ſolid figures, either poſsible or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall among men, but only by ſolid meaſures. For it is not poſſible for a man to finde out, and to know the true quantity of a ſolid body, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>intuitivè,</hi> as Angels doe; or, <hi>applicativè,</hi> as in lineall meaſures, but onely
<hi>diſcurſivè,</hi> and <hi>per ratiocinium,</hi> by the diſcurſive faculty, and by counting and calculating numbers, which as it is the proper Act of mans reaſon onely, ſo is it here, for this reaſon onely, or for this reaſon chiefly ſaid to be the meaſure of a man.</p>

For, if the reaſon, why S. <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; the Prophet
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> doe deſcribe this heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to have been of a ſquare figure, and to have had twelve gates, and twelve Tribes, and twelve names of twelve Apoſtles, be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things, had ſometimes a reall and actuall exiſtence in the literall

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oraſmuch as the compaſſe of that City in the laſt of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is in the text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid to be 8000 cubits, it is evident that the meaſure of 12000 furlongs cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be the lineall meaſure, either of one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108880:21"/> ſide, or of the whole compaſſe of the new <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> For ſuppoſing that this meaſure of
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> (which is but a Cubit and an hand breadth (as ſhall be ſhewed) were five foote long, yet 18000 of theſe meaſures would make but
144 furlongs, which is not the 84 part of 12000 furlongs. Wherefore there is no poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that 12000 furlongs ought to be underſtood to be the meaſure, either of one ſide, or of the whole compaſſe of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner, if any one were willing, (as ſome interpreters have endeavoured) to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this meaſure of 12000 furlongs, to be the ſquare meaſure of the <hi>Area</hi> or plat-forme of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> he muſt then grant that the <hi>perimeter</hi> or compaſſe of ſuch an <hi>Area</hi> muſt be 436 furlongs lat the leaſt, as may be plainly proved by extracting the ſquare roote of 12000: but the compaſſe of the ſame City, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribes it, cannot exceed 144 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs as it is above ſhewed. Therefore neither can theſe
12000 furlongs be the ſquare or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall meaſure, either of all, or of any one of the ſides of this new <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remaineth then that if this City doe agree in meaſures (as of neceſſity it muſt) with that City meaſured by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that this meaſure of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108880:21"/> 12000 furlongs, muſt needs be underſtood, of ſolid furlongs. For according to this meaſure only it is poſſible to reconcile theſe two divers meaſures of the ſame City. It muſt needs be therefore, that that Cube, whoſe content or ſolid meaſure is 12000 furlongs, muſt be in compaſſe 18000 Cubits, according as it is ſet downe by <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that this may appeare, ſomething muſt be ſaid of the true length of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Cubits, and S. <hi>Johns</hi> furlongs; Concerning the Cubit uſed by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the deſcription of his laſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it is evident out of the 40 chap. and 5. verſ. and out of the 41. chap. 8. verſ. and out of the 43. chap. and 13. verſ. that his Cubit is longer then other Cubits ordinarily uſed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by one ſpanne or hand breadth, which is the 4 part of the uſuall Cubit, as
<hi>Villalpandus</hi> &amp;<note place="margin">Tomo 3. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus urbis Pag 68,

But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and uſuall Cubit mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was about two foote and an halfe. And therefore in ſome of our Engliſh tranſlations, the marginall note equalleth 2000 Cubits to a mile, And ſo doth <hi>

<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> it is meaſured, it muſt be granted, that if 625 foote make one furlong, then the compaſſe of this City, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuch furlongs muſt be 90 furlongs. Which meaſure, how neere it comes to agree with the ſolid meaſure ſet downe by S.
<hi>John,</hi> may eaſily be demonſtrated by extracting the ſolid roote of 12000: which if I have rightly performed, the compaſſe of this Cubicall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by neceſſary conſequence, muſt needs be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene 91 and 92 furlongs. And although it<note place="margin">91. ſtad. 71. paſſ. 2. ped.
11. un.</note> doth not exactly and preciſely agree with the former, yet one or two furlongs are not to be regarded in ſo large a compaſſe; yet not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be regarded, becauſe a difference, if it could be proved, were not to be regarded, but becauſe it is beyond all compariſon farre
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108880:22"/> more probable that theſe two meaſures doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agree becauſe the Cityes are both one, then that any writer can now exactly ſet downe the juſt length both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cubit, &amp; of the <hi>Roman</hi> furlongs. For I ſuppoſe it were great ignorance for any man to affirme that the juſt lengths of both theſe meaſures can be now proved by any unqueſtionable monument of antiquity, or undeniable authority. For being there is nothing in this ſublunarie world im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall and unchangeable, but only wordes written that can be without alteration tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity; it hath been therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a thing unpoſsible untill this age to finde out any meanes demonſtrative, how the exact length of any knowne meaſure, may without ſenſible errour be exactly and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tranſmitted to all ſucceeding generations. But howſoever the juſt length of the Iewiſh Cubit be uncertaine and utterly loſt, yet the Roman furlongs and the Roman foote are not yet ſo forgotten, but that we may come very neere unto the truth, as <hi>Snellius</hi> in his book <hi>de terrae ambitu</hi> hath probably defined it. And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
22500 Cubits, which is the meaſure of the City meaſurd by
<hi>Ezechiel,</hi> to be equall unto 57233 Roman feete, which is neere unto the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108880:23"/> Compaſſe of the new
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> if I have caſt it right, we may know the true length of the Jewiſh Cubit to have beene neere about two foote and an halfe, and halfe an inch, and one and one quarter of a quarter of an inch, and a little more, and by this meanes I believe the true length of the <hi>Iewes</hi> Cubits many be better knowen then by any other. Wherefore I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that theſe reaſons above alleaged, and rightly underſtood, are abundantly ſufficient to ſhew, not onely a probability, that this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of 12000 furlongs may, but a neceſsity, that it muſt be underſtood to be the Solid mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this City; and therefore ſuch a meaſure, which,

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if it were poſsible, yet it were a kinde of tautologie, to ſet downe againe in the next words that meaſure of the wall, which may be evidently and certainly knowne by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the City before declared. This mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then muſt be underſtood, either of the height of this wall, or of the thicknes of this wall, or of both: and the meaning muſt be, that either the wall was 144 cubits high or 144 cubits broad, or elſe that, according to both theſe dimentions of height and breadth, the wall was
144 cubits of ſquare meaſure. And this laſt kinde of interpretation of theſe words howſoever it may ſeeme intricate an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

And that this kinde of ſquare meaſure is to be underſtood in this place, I take it to be more then probable for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that meaſure of the wall (<hi>caeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> other reſpects being equall) is to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before any other, by which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne quantity of the wall may be moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and according to moſt dimentions, made knowne and diſcerned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuppoſing that 144 cubits are the ſquare meaſure of this wall according to its height and thickneſſe, it will follow, that not the height onely, nor the thickneſſe onely, but that all the unknowne dimentions of this wall may be found out by this number. Whereas contrariwiſe, if wee underſtand this meaſure of 144 cubits to be the thickneſſe of the wall, then the height of the wall remaines unknowne, and if we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the height of the wall, then the thickneſſe remaines unknowne. And although it were certaine, that it were meant of one of theſe meaſures onely, yet it is ambiguous,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108880:24"/> and unpoſsible to be knowne by the words of the text, which of them is here intended. And although it were knowne which of theſe two meaſures is here meant, yet the figure and proportion of the wall would ſtill be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. But if, as it is above ſaide, this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be underſtood of ſquare cubits, then all theſe uncertainties and ambiguities are avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and extinguiſhed; and it muſt be granted that this one number doth repreſent the figure of the wall, and is the meaſure of both theſe, otherwaies unknowne, dimentions. For, as this number is a ſquare number, having 4 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall ſides, each of them conſiſting of 12 u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo this wall muſt be conceived to be of a ſquare figure, each ſide being 12 cubits. The foundation then of this wall was 12 cubits broad, the height of the wall on the inſide next unto the City was 12 cubits, and the height of the wall on the outſide was 12 cubits, and the breadth of the wall on the top was 12 cubits, ſo theſe foure lines contained and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the figure of the wall; Or, to ſpeake more properly, theſe 4 lines contained and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated that continuating <hi>ſuperficies</hi> and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary plaine, which did cut the length of the wall according to right Angles: and in reſpect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108880:25"/> of the figure and capacitie of this plaine, the meaſure of the wall it ſelfe (according to all dimentions not hitherto expreſſed) may be moſt truely, moſt properly, and moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly ſaid to be 144 cubits.</p>
               <p>And after this manner <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>illalpand</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands and interprets this meaſure, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of his words <hi>parte 1. Apparatûs vrbis &amp; Templi, libro 2. cap.</hi> 20. where he ſaith,

If then according to the opinion of <hi>Villalpand,</hi> and for the reaſons above alleaged, the number of 144 cubits be a Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meaſure, and therefore ſuch a meaſure as is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108880:25"/> not lineally applicable to the wall of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> then it follows, that mans reaſon by the diſcurſive faculty muſt firſt count &amp; extract the root of this number, before he can knowe and underſtand what the lineal meaſure of the thickneſſe and height of the wall is. And this is the reaſon that the next words are added, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>menſura hominis quae eſt Angeli,</hi> it is the meaſure of a man which the Angel uſeth. For ſo theſe words ought to be tranſlated, and ſo doth <hi>Villalpand</hi> rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them out of <hi>Ribera</hi> upon the Revelation; for they are (as it muſt needs be granted) an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of thoſe meaſures of the City and wall ſet down by the Angel in the words before. Neither doe they import any thing concerning the ſhape of the Angell, or any other meaning; but only this, that although the meaſurer were an Angel, yet he meaſured the City &amp; the wall, after the ſame manner that men uſe to meaſure ſuch quantities, and by ſuch meaſures as have been invented by men, and are commonly uſed among them. Now if there be no other way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by men, by which men uſually doe, or truly can meaſure quanties containing three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentions, but only by ſolid meaſure; nor no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way by which men either uſually doe, or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:108880:26"/> poſsibly can, meaſure quantities containing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two dimentions, but onely by ſuperficiall or ſquare meaſure; then it muſt needs follow, that the meaſure of the City muſt be underſtood to be a ſolid meaſure, becauſe it is the meaſure of a ſolid figure containing three dimentions, as it is above proved: and the meaſure of the wall, muſt be underſtood to be a ſuperficiall, or ſquare meaſure, becauſe it is the meaſure of two dimentions onely, it being above ſhewed, that it is altogether unprobable, that it ought to be underſtood of one dimention only, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unpoſsible to underſtand it of three.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here remaineth one thing yet for the farther clearing of theſe meaſures, and that is to ſhew, that in other places of the holy Scriptures, the like phraſes and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are uſed by the holy Ghoſt. And firſt for the ſolid meaſure, J ſee not how it can be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered or avoided but that the ſame meaſure and phraſe is uſed in the 7 chapter of the firſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108880:26"/> book of Kings, where the ſtones with which the wall of the Court was built, are ſaid to be ſtones of 8 cubits, and ſtones of 10 cubits. It is certaine that theſe ſtones were ſquared ſtones, cut (as it is ſaid in the text) according to the meaſures of hewed ſtones. And it is certain alſo that the cubit was about two foot and an halfe long. If therefore 10 cubits be the meaſure of the length, or of the breadth, or of the thicknes of one of theſe ſtones: it muſt be granted that one of theſe ſtones, if he were every way ſquare was 25 foot long, and 25 foot broad, and 25 foot high, &amp; therefore did containe 15625 ſolid foot of ſtone, which is above 240 waine loads. But it is incredible and againſt reaſon, and the truth of the ſtory, that theſe ſtones were ſo exceeding great. And it muſt alſo follow, that the wall which was built with 3 rowes of ſuch ſtones, was 20 foot thick and more, and 60 foot high and upward, all which is ſo farre from the truth of the ſtory, and ſo diſagreeing to reaſon, that there is no man (as I am perſwaded) ſo vainely credulous, as to beleeve it. It remaineth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this meaſure is to be underſtood of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid meaſure, by which meaſure ſtone and tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are commonly and uſually meaſured. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which meaſure, a ſquared ſtone of 8
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108880:27"/> cubits, is but two cubits long, and two cubits broad and two cubits in height: and 3 ranks of ſuch ſtones, with one ranke of Cedar beames, will make a wall of ſuch a probable and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient height and thickneſſe as was requiſite for the walls which are mentioned in the firſt book of Kings cap. 6. and the 36 verſe, and in the 10, 11, and
12 verſe of the chapter next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. I ſay therefore that as in this place of Scripture the meaſure of 8 or 10 cubits muſt in all probability be underſtood of ſolid meaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo likewiſe the meaſure of 12000 furlongs, mentioned in the 21 chap. of the Revelation, may be underſtood after the ſame manner, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being the phraſe is not unlike, and that as in the one place, 8 or 10 cubits are ſaid to be the meaſure of the ſtone it ſelfe, and not of the length or breadth, or thickneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or compaſſe of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo alſo in the other place, 12000 furlongs are ſaid to be the meaſure of the City it ſelfe; and not of the length or breadth, or thicknes, or compaſſe of it.</p>
               <p>As concerning ſquare and ſuperficiall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure invented and uſed by men, it is evident that the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures vouchſafeth to allude unto this alſo, and as it were directly and plainly to point at it. And this may in ſome ſort
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108880:27"/> appeare out of the 43 chap. and 16 V. of
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> but moſt evidently out of the 20 V. of the laſt chap. of
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where it ſaid, <hi>all the oblation ſhall be 25 thouſand by 25 thouſand, &amp;c.</hi> Concerning which place of Scripture, I will here ſet down the words of <hi>Haffenrefferus</hi> in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> pag. 102, and 103. where he ſaith as followeth; <hi>Notanda eſt phraſis geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca quam demonſtrator Prophetae ex mediis Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticorum ſcholis huic ſuae deſcriptioni adhibuit, &amp; Spiritus Sanctus phraſi Geometricâ ex media ſchola Mathematicorum deſumptâ expreſsè loquitur,</hi> [Area 25000 Cubitorum Per 25000 Cubito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quadrata,] <hi>quae res &amp; Mathematicas diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas commendat, &amp; quod Theologiae ſtudioſus earun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem non prorſus ignarus eſſe debeat non obſcurè de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrat,</hi> that is, the Geometricall phraſe is to be noted, which is taken out of the midſt of the Schooles of the Mathematitians, andin this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription uſed by him that ſhewed this viſion to the Prophet; and the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh expreſly by ſuch a Geometricall phraſe as is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the midſt of the Mathematick Schooles, [an <hi>Area of 25000 Cubits, ſquared by 25 thouſand Cubits</hi>] which as it doth much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Mathematicall ſciences, ſo doth it not obſcurely intimate, that a ſtudent in divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108880:28"/> ought not to be altogether ignorant of them. If in this place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the holy Ghoſt uſeth a circumlocution, that he might by a geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call phraſe, and by a number multiplied by it ſelfe, expreſſe and intimate the ſquare and plain meaſure of a peece of ground; why may he not then in another place ſet downe the ſquare meaſure it ſelfe, by one number, without any circumlocution at all? If in the firſt place the ſides of a ſquare number be given, and yet the ſquare number be not expreſſed, but left to be found by him that will multiply the ſides into themſelves, as S.
<hi>Hierome</hi> hath done on this place, why may not then the ſquare number it ſelfe be given in another place of Scripture, and yet the ſides of it be left unexpreſſed, to be found out by him that will extract the roote of it? As therefore it was needleſſe that the ſquare number it ſelfe ſhould be expreſſed to <hi>Ezekiel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> becauſe by multiplying 25000 by it ſelfe we may certainly know that the ſquare meaſure of the holy oblation was 625 Millions of ſquare cubits, or 667 miles as S <hi>Hierome</hi> counteth it: ſo it was needleſſe that the lineall meaſures of the wall ſhould be expreſſed by the Angell to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> becauſe by extracting the ſquare roote of 144, we may certainely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108880:28"/> know that the lineall meaſure of the wall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its thickneſſe and height was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely 12 cubits.</p>

For being the holy Ghoſt affecteth (as it were) this number of 12
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108880:29"/> more then any other, (as it is above ſhewed;) and keepeth this number conſtantly through the whole deſcription of this new <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> as if nothing were pleaſing and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him (as indeed it is not) but that which is either numbred with this number of 12, or built upon it; it was therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that the ſame number ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (if it were poſible) in the meaſures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. But it was not poſsible to ſet downe the true, &amp; yet the ſame length, or breadth, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of this City, by the number of 12; either in unities, Tens, Hundreds, Thouſands, or Millions: either by Reeds, Cubits, furlongs, handbreadthes, ſpans, or any other meaſure named in the Scriptures.

So likewiſe neither are 12 cubits, nor 1200 cubits, nor 12000 cubits, nor
120000, nor 1200000, nor 12000000 of cubits, or the ſame numbers of any other meaſures named in the Scriptures, equall to any meaſures of this City above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, excepting only the ſolid meaſure, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid. As therefore there was a neceſſity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108880:29"/> that the Solid meaſure ſhould be ſet downe, becauſe that only could be expreſſed by the number of 12 having thouſands added to it; ſo was it neceſſary alſo that of all other ſolid meaſures, furlongs ſhould be taken for the ſame reaſon. For as no other number with this meaſure, ſo is it certaine that no other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with this number could expreſſe the juſt quantity of this City.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon (and perhaps the chiefe reaſon) why the holy Ghoſt would have the magnitude of this new <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> expreſſed by the ſolid meaſure, is, that there might be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and evident example in the Scriptures, how to count and apply the number of the beaſt; that ſo having found out that number which is oppoſed unto 12, and having added thouſands and furlongs to it, we might have the ſolid meaſure and content of that Cube gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, whoſe
<hi>perimeter</hi> is equall to the compaſſe of the <hi>Romiſh Babylon:</hi> as 12000 furlongs are the ſolid meaſure of that Cube, whoſe
<hi>perimeter</hi> is equall to the compaſſe of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But of this in its due place.</p>
               <p>As concerning the reaſon why the meaſure of the wall is not expreſſed by lineall meaſures, it may be anſwered, that although the number
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108880:30"/> of 12 might have been retained, and by it the true, and the ſame lineall meaſures of this wall deſcribed, yet it cannot be denied, but that the true meaſures of the wall, and the number of
12 are both neceſſarily, although myſtically implied, and as purpoſely intended by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in the number 144, as if they had been many times expreſly named. For this number is ſo ſignificantly applicable, not only to the meaſures and ſtructure of the wall here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, but alſo to that which is by the wall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; that it may be truely ſaid, that this number conſidered abſolutely in it ſelfe, (and not as it doth by Cubits here in this place ſhew the ſquare meaſure of the wall,) is (as it were) an <hi>idaea</hi> of the <hi>hierarchy</hi> of the Church: the wiſdome of God having purpoſely linked two types together, that the one might unfold the other: the one being an imaginary ſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of a materiall building; the other an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible forme of an immateriall number: both of them ſignifying, that as the number 12 was the meaſure, number, and foundation of the Citty, Gates, and wall of the ancient and literall
<hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and was, in reſpect of the 12 Patriarks, the root from whence the 12 Tribes had their originall according to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108880:30"/> fleſh; ſo the ſame number of 12 ſhould be the only conſpicuous &amp; remarkable number in the foundation &amp; ſtructure of the ſpirituall &amp; new <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> in which the 12 Apoſtles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are 12 ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall fathers anſwereable to the 12 Patriarks: and are 12 foundation-ſtones layd by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, upon which foundation, and according to which foundation, (that is, by multiplying the doctrine of the Apoſtles by it ſelfe onely,) all the ſpirituall builders of Gods Church in the times to come, ought to erect and ſquare their buildings. And they are alſo placed as 12 Angels at the 12 gates, to keep out (as it were) with a two edged ſword every thing that defileth; and to admit into this City by the gates of Baptiſme, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted firſt and originally unto them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured by the 12 oxen under the braſen Sea, 12000 of every tribe; that is all thoſe faithfull Chriſtians and true Jſraelites which can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their ſpirituall genealogy from the faith and doctrine of the 12 Apoſtles. And this is without all queſtion, the true and naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the numbers and meaſures of this new <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning which it is to be obſerved, that thoſe interpreters which did not underſtand

                  <hi>Forbes</hi> and other commentators upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation haue trodden out before me, but I am now come to that place, where they either ſtood ſtill, or turned out of the way. It is true M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <hi>Forbes</hi> and others affirme, that the number 144 is the number which is oppoſed to the number of the Beaſt; and that, as it is a ſquare and perfect number, built and raiſed upon the number 12 onely, which is the roote of it; ſo the Church of Chriſt is a ſquare and perfect building, built upon the doctrine of the 12 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. It is alſo true, that as the number
666 is neither a ſquare nor perfect number, nor built upon the number 12: ſo neither is the <hi>Romiſh Hierarchy</hi> a ſquare and perfect building, neither is it built upon the doctrine of the 12 Apoſtles. All this is true, but this is not all that is true; nor the tenth part of that which may be found out by this number. All this is but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative deſcription, ſhewing rather, what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is not, then truly defining what he is. And thoſe interpreters which reſt ſatisfied with ſo imperfect a deſcription, muſt confeſſe that they know no more of Antichriſt by this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then what is plaine and evident by many places of the Sriptures. Why doe they not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the grounds, which they themſelues
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108880:32"/> have laid, farther proſecute their owne interpretations? Why doe they not ſeeke out the roote of the beaſts number, as well as the roote of Gods number, that ſo they may know, not only negatively, what is not the foundation of the Romiſh Hierarchy, but alſo poſitively, what it is? Were they ſo unaquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Arithmetick, that they knew not what the ſquare roote of a number is, nor how it ought to be extracted? I dare not accuſe ſuch learned men of this neſcience, much leſſe of their ignorance in this kinde. Perhaps ſome of them through incogitancy, not rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering theſe words in the text, <hi>numerus enim hominis eſt,</hi> did thinke it unbeſeeming the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and the majeſty of the ſcriptures, to wrap up ſuch divine myſteries in humane and heatheniſh inventions. True it is indeed, The extraction of the rootes of numbers is an humane, and perhaps an heatheniſh invention; but it is a lawfull, a profitable and an uſefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. It is the very ground, and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Arithmeticke</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and eſſentiall a part of theſe Sciences, that neither of them can well ſubſiſt without it. By it was found out that famous invention, for which it is ſaid, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſacrificed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108880:33"/> an <hi>Hecatombe</hi> unto the Gods; and why may not Chriſtians finde out as great a myſtery by it as ever Heathens did? Certainely if the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God will at any time vouchſafe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock this numbers myſtery by any humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, (as the words themſelves ſeeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate) there is none in reſpect of it ſelfe more probable, then this, by which ſo many, and ſo famous myſteryes have been, and dayly are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. I ſay therefore, why doe not thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter writers, which in part have rightly diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wherein the myſtery of Gods number doth conſiſt, extract the roote of 666 alſo? For had they extracted the ſquare roote of this number of the beaſt, then had they truly endeavoured to interpret this number, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that they themſelves do interpret that number, which is oppoſed unto it; then had they found out that number, which is myſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implied in 666, as 12 is in 144; then had they found out that number, which is chiefely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by 666, as 12 is by 144; then had they found out that nmber, which is the meaſure, number, and foundation, as well of that mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall City, wherein Antichriſt doth reſide, as alſo of that ſtate and government, by which he ruleth in it. For as the number 12 is not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108880:33"/> onely exquiſitely applicable to that eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call government, and Hierarchy, which Chriſt did firſt inſtitute in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> but doth alſo deſcribe, and meaſure the materiall City it ſelfe, as is partly above ſhewed: ſo the roote of the Beaſts number, which is the number op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to 12, is not only exquiſitely and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly applicable to that government, and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, which was by Antichriſt firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but doth alſo deſcribe, and characterize that materiall City, in which this government was firſt erected. And all this, by that which followeth ſhall be clearly and evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>But firſt, for as much as this opinion, which I ſhall here ſet downe, doth differ from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this reſpect, namely, in that it affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the chiefe myſtery doth not conſiſt in the application of the number 666 unto Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, but in finding out another number, by counting of this number, which other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is moſt properly, and moſt remarkably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable unto him; I thinke it therefore neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary not to paſſe over ſuch proofes as the text it ſelfe affordeth for the full confirmation of this point, wherein the difference conſiſteth. For although it cannot be denied, but that the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108880:34"/> like interpretation of the oppoſite number (as it is above ſhewed) is a ſtrong, and violentpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, why the Beaſts number ſhould be thus interpreted; yet the words of the text are ſo appoſite, and do ſo neceſſarily inforce this interpretation, that I ſee not how it can bee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly avoided, although there were no example in the Scripture for it.</p>

               <p>This temporall power and principalitie over the city of
<hi>Rome,</hi> did ſucceed the government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours in
<hi>Rome</hi> (who were the ſixth head, that was in the time of S.
<hi>John</hi>) and did receive a deadly wound, perhaps part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſome Emperours, and perhaps partly by ſome ſeditious tumults of the Citizens, but chiefly by the incurſions of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> who endeavoured to erect a new forme of goverment in <hi>Rome,</hi> and did ſo far effect it, as was neceſſary for the deadly wounding of the Popes dominion, but yet could not ſo utterly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108880:36"/> aboliſh it, but that it revived againe afterwards. This temporall dominion being revived and having the Exarchie of
<hi>Ravenna,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things added unto it, became formidable to all other temporall Princes, and to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himſelfe, whom I account one of thoſe ten Kings which was to give his power to this Beaſt. Of this temporall power <hi>Funecius</hi> ſpeaks where he ſaith, <hi>Ex hoc tempore Papae in Italia do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini, ſubinde quaeſiverunt, quo modo potentiam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſtabilirent: donèc tandem à Pipino, maximam Italiae partem, quam vi ſubegerant, dono acceperint.</hi> After which time the Biſhop &amp; clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> uſurping and enjoying without controlement this temporall principalitie, and being aſsiſted with the obedience of other temporall Princes (ſome of whom they forced to obey them by their dragon-like power, and ſome they decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by working miracles, and by the efficacie of errour) began now to ſeek out ſome better title then his own uſurpation and the donation of Princes, by which he might now eſtabliſh himſelfe and the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> in his temporall principality. And conſidering that ſome of his predec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſors having mouthes ſpeaking great things, did begin to clay me to themſelves uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction over the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108880:37"/> whole world, he reſolved that it was his onely way actually to ſettle ſuch univerſall Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall power on himſelfe, as was rather clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then poſſeſſed by his predeceſſors. And ſeeing that he could have no good title to ſuch an univerſall Eccleſiaſticall power as he aymed at, either as he was a Biſhop, or as he was an Archbiſhop, or as he was a Patriarke, he was therefore neceſsitated to make the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that he was the Vicar of Chriſt, and that in this he ſucceeded S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who derived from Chriſt this great authority peculiar to himſelfe and his ſucceſſors. And now having derived this great power to himſelfe by authority of the holy Scriptures &amp; by divine right, (as he makes the world believe,) he is now become a Beaſt having two hornes like the Lambe, that is, two powers both Temporall, and Eccleſiaſticall; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
<hi>directè,</hi> and Temporall <hi>indirectè</hi> over all kingdomes in the world. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this unlawfull temporall power which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> firſt uſurped I conceive to be the firſt Beaſt whoſe head was wounded, &amp; I believe that the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> were even in thoſe times, before they uſurped any unlawfull Eccleſiaſticall power, the Antichriſt, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Eccleſiaſticall or Epiſcopall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108880:37"/> but in reſpect of that their unlawfull tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power above mentioned. Secondly, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſecond Beaſt mentioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 11. to be that unlawfull univerſall Eccleſiaſticall power which theſe latter times have ſetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pope; and I believe that he is the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, not as Biſhop, or as Archbiſhop, or Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, but as he pretends himſelfe to be Pope &amp; Vicar of Chriſt having ſuch a tranſcendent Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power as is incommunicable to any other upon earth. This Eccleſiaſticall power doth now include in it <hi>efficaciter</hi> although <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directè,</hi> all that temporall power which the firſt Beaſt had, and all other temporall power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it. And for this reaſon the ſecond Beaſt is ſaid to exerciſe all the power of the firſt Beaſt in his preſence. For ſo the Pope continuing ſtill a temporall Prince and Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth now all that temporall power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by vertue of his unlawfull Eccleſiaſticall power, which for divers hundreds of yeares, the Biſhops his predeceſſors were formerly content to hold, onely by the pretended and perhaps forged donations of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes.</p>
               <p>Now laſtly, as touching the Image of the Beaſt, I ſuppoſe that to be the perſon of the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108880:38"/> Pope for the time being: eſpecially he being conſidered as he is <hi>Vicarius Chriſti;</hi> for in this reſpect the Cardinals and others his followers doe flatly adore him when he is elected, and doe teach ſuch Adoration to be due unto him. And this worſhip and adoration which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him, although it be not ſufficient to<note place="margin">Qui ſingit ſacros auro vel mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more vultus Non facit ille deos, Qui regat ille facit.</note> transforme him really and truely into ſuch a Vicar of Chriſt as they pretend him to be: yet it is ſufficient to transforme him really and truely into ſuch an Jmage and ſuch an Idoll as is in the text deſcribed. Theſe things J have ſet downe <hi>Obiter,</hi> and breifly to ſhew that theſe two Beaſts, and the Image of the Beaſt doe all concurre to the making up of that one great Antichriſt, whoſe city, State, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are deſcribed by the Beaſts number, and to ſhew how unprobable it is that all theſe things ſhould be meant of one particular man as the papiſts would have Antichriſt to be.</p>
               <p>It were an eaſy thing to confirme the ſame truth by many teſtimonies, both of proteſtants, and papiſts. But becauſe it is certaine and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved by many learned writers that the great and chiefe Antichriſt ſhould not be one perſon only, but a ſtate of government, or body politick, I will therefore recite here the words
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108880:38"/> of <hi>Cotterius</hi> only, a late writer, who as J con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivereaſoneth unanſwerably to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in his commentaries upon the 13 cap. of the Apoc. where he ſpeaketh in theſe words, <hi>Numerus enim hominis est:</hi>

The Prophet ſpeaketh of the Beaſt, to whom the name and appellation of a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree. The meaning therefore is, that this number of the Beaſt is of the ſame kinde, that other numbers are, which are uſed by us, that are men, and inhabitants of this world. For all numbering is not after the ſame manner; we that are men number our things by tens, &amp; by hundreds, &amp; by thouſands, and by tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; but why may not Angels rank and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe unities according to other progreſsions &amp;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108880:39"/> proportions? For as much then, as this number is the number of a man, that is, a number of the ſame kinde that other numbers are, that are U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men, therefore we cannot doubt, but the computation, and counting of this number is ſuch a kind of computation, as is uſuall among men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I aske therefore what it is, to count a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber after the manner of men? And, what literall and grammaticall ſenſe can be given of theſe words, except they be underſtood of ſuch a kinde of computation, as is both uſuall among men, and proper to numbers only? but there is no other way whereby men uſually doe, or properly can be ſaid to count numbers, but by ſuch a kinde of computation, which either is, or is reducible unto one of theſe following; namely either by Addition, or Subſtraction, or Multiplication, or Diviſion, or by the extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Roots: and therefore it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that the number of the Beaſt muſt be counted according to one of theſe kindes of computation. But in all theſe kinds of compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in every one of them, the end and ſcope is, by one or more numbers given, to find out one other number, which was not known nor could be expreſſed before the computation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108880:39"/> was performed. And hence it followeth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, that if the number of the Beaſt muſt be counted, then there muſt be ſome other number found out by it, beſide the number it ſelfe, which is named and expreſſed.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108880:40"/> words, <hi>Duos ergo numeros hic intelligi oportet, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum nominis eius, five Dei: alterum Beſtiae, five ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis.</hi> That is, Two numbers therefore muſt be underſtood in this place, one being the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Beaſts name, or of God; the other of the Beaſt, or of man, for Gods number is not the ſame with mans number. By which words I know not what elſe can be underſtood, but this; That the number 666 is not only the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Beaſts name, but alſo the number of God, that is, it is a number which God hath pleaſed to name, and reveale to men, that by counting of this number, they might finde out that other number, which it pleaſed not God, expreſſely to name in this place, but rather my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically to conceale, becauſe it is more properly the number of the Beaſt, then this, which is the number of his name. To theſe words of
<hi>Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> may be added the like teſtimony of <hi>Pet. Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> in his booke <hi>de numerorum myſteriis,</hi> where writing of the ſame place of Scripture, and of the number 666 he hath the like words, <hi>Duos ergo numeros hic intelligi oportet, &amp;c.</hi> two num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers therefore muſt here be underſtood, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now therefore it being evident, that by counting of this number there ought ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther number to be found out, the next thing to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108880:40"/> be inquired after, is, what kinde of computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought here to be uſed. For although it be granted, that this number muſt be counted, and that it cannot be counted, but that there muſt ſome other number be found out by it, yet for as much as numbers may be counted divers wayes, (as is above ſaid) and there may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers numbers found out by them, a reaſon may well be demanded, why this counting of the number ſhould be reſtrained to the extraction of the root only, rather then to any other kinde of computation? To which I might anſwer, that the example of the oppoſite number (which is to be counted after this manner) is a ſufficient reaſon; but I doe rather anſwer that this reſtriction is not only probable, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, becauſe there is only one num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber named and expreſſed in the text. For if any other kind of computation had been intended, two numbers at the leaſt ought to have been expreſſed. For neither Addition, nor Subſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor Multiplication, nor Diviſion can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but there muſt be two numbers at the leaſt given; that by them a third, that is, either a Totum, or a Remainder, or a Product, or a Quotient may be found out; but in the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Roots, one number only ought to be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108880:41"/> expreſſed whoſe root is to be extracted: and for this cauſe it is flatly againſt the literall, and the grammaticall ſenſe of the words of the text, to underſtand any other immediate computation or calculation by them. It were an imperfect ſpeech to ſay, here is wiſdome, let him that hath underſtanding adde the number of the Beaſt, for it is the number of a man, &amp; his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is 666, and yet not to declare what number it is to which this ſhould be added. So likewiſe if it had been ſaid, Let him that hath underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſubtract the number of the Beaſt, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666; it would be demanded from what number it ſhould be ſubtracted: or if it had been ſaid, Here is wiſdome, let him that hath underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding multiply the number of the Beaſt, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the number of the Beaſt, for it is the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a man, and his number is 666; who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how ambiguous, and imperfect the ſpeech is; becauſe there is no number expreſſed or intimated by which it ſhould be multiplied or divided?

               <p>To extract the ſquare roote of a number gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is to find out the greateſt number, which being multiplied into it ſelfe and having the fractions added to the product, (if there be any fraction remaining) maketh the firſt number.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108880:42"/> have written of Arithmeticke. And although many learned, and worthy Divines (whoſe bookes I account my ſelfe not worthy to beare) are perhaps ignorant of it: yet is this kind of Mathematicall learning called wiſedome in<note place="margin">Moſes was learned in all the wiſdome of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 22.</note> the Scriptures, and in this may conſiſt one part of that wiſedome and underſtanding, which is in the wordes of the text required for the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of this myſtery. Let him therefore that hath this skill in humane Arts, and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and let him that hath underſtanding to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the rootes of numbers, extract the roote of the Beaſts number, and he ſhall find that fatall number to be 25, and that the fractions remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning are 41: and that this is proved by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
25 by it ſelfe, which makes 625, and by adding the fractions which are 41 unto 625, both which numbers added together, make the juſt ſumme 666. And although the roote of this number, not being a ſimple roote, as the roote of

12 is the greateſt number, and the leaſt number, and the only number of unities of the ſame denomination with the number 144, (which is or can be contained in) the roote of 144: ſo 25 is the greateſt number, and the leaſt number, and the only number of unities of the ſame denomination with the number 666, (which is or can be contained in) the roote of the number 666.

Or that the Cardinals are not anſwerable to the Apoſtles in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Hierarchy, becauſe they have red hats, which Jbelieve the Apoſtles had not. Beſides, it is often times an uſuall and ordinary thing, <hi>etiam praxi mathematicâ,</hi> in many arithmeticall operations, to caſt away, and not to regard the fractions of roots, becauſe the root or Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall number it ſelfe is of ſufficient exactneſſe to prove or effect the concluſion, which is deſired; nay ſometimes and in ſome caſes, when rootes of numbers are to be extracted, they cannot make the fractions to be uſefull to their purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, though they would. For ſuppoſe a captaine haue 666 men under his command, and would reduce them to a ſquare figure of equall ſides and ranks: to effect his purpoſe he muſt extract the root of
666, which he would finde to be 25 41 / 51, and by that he would conclude that he muſt of neceſſity take the number 25 to be the number of rankes, and the number of men in euery ranke, and no other number would ſerve his turne. As for the 41 odd men he muſt reject them as unuſefull, if he will have his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

<hi>Pſalme</hi> &amp; elſe where maketh the myſtery of this number to conſiſt in the roote of it which is 7 without any ſcruple of any fraction: and it were eaſie to ſet downe many authors which interpret the ſame and other numbers after the ſame manner. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is uſuall among men in many caſes, and neceſſary in ſome, not to regard the fractions, but onely the Cardinall number in the extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of rootes; why then may we not doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in extracting the roote of 666? why may we not conſider the number 25 firſt by it ſelfe, and as it is the only Cardinall number oppoſed to 12, by which the roote of 666 can be truely expreſſed; and afterwards as it hath relation to the fractions, eſpecially being the unities of the roote of this number are ſometimes to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Perſons, who are things indiviſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to parts or fractions, as are alſo the unities of numbers eſſentially and abſolutely conſidered. And the truth is, that no number of fractions, as fractions, is properly a part of any roote eſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entially conſidered: for howſoever it be true that fractions, being reduced to ſome certaine denomination, doe more exactly ſhew the ſide

And the fractions (if it be well conſidered) are rather part of the roote of the ſecond number into which the firſt is ſuppoſed to be reſolved, then of the roote of the firſt number which was to be extracted. As for example the roote of 666 is 25 806 / 1000 which fractions doe ſuppoſe every u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of 666, to be multiplied into one million; and every unite of the roote 25 to be multiplied into one thouſand: for if the figures of the roote and of the fractions be joyned together they doe make 25806. which number is the true roote of 666000000 ſo that 806, (being now unities of the ſame denomination with the number 666000000,) are more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part of the roote of 666 millions, then of the roote of 666 unities.

But ſuch ſhould conſider that one reaſon why theſe kinds of numbers are called rootes, is, becauſe every ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is in this reſpect like unto the roote of a tree; for as one roote hath many branches growing upon it, and iſſuing from it, although ſome grow nearer the roote then others: ſo the ſame number may be the root of divers other numbers, which have all a reall, and yet a diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering dependance upon it. And although aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending upward, there be no infallible directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the roote to any one particular branch, yet deſcending from the top of any one branch, there is certaine and infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the ſame roote: and ſo whoſoever ſhall goe to extract the roote of any number greater then 624 and leſſe then 676, according to ſuch rules of art as are, and have hitherto been commonly taught, and generally received, ſhall be infallibly directed, not to the number 26, but to the number 25, &amp; to that number only, as unto the only Cardinall number firſt ſought after in the extraction of all rootes; &amp; this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber either by it ſelfe, or having ſome fractions appendant to it, is the true root of all ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as are included between thoſe two num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers above mentioned Neither is it uſual or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108880:45"/> truly to expreſſe any root that hath fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by any other Cardinall number, but only by that number which being multiplied into it ſelfe produceth the greateſt ſquare number contained in that number, whoſe roote is to be extracted. And although there be divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther numbers beſides this number 666, by any one of which we might have been infallibly directed to this number 25, as unto the only Cardinall number by which their roots could have been expreſſed: yet there is no one of thoſe numbers but only the number 666, whoſe moſt perfect figure doth repreſent the figure of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the moſt perfect figure of the number 144 doth repreſent the figure of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> and for this reaſon chiefly, and for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others (as ſhall be ſhewed abundantly in due place) it was both convenient, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that this number 666 ſhould be choſen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any other. But if it be objected, that the roote of 666 is nearer to 26, then 25; yet I anſwere that it cannot be truely ſaid to be 26, but is truely ſaid to be 25: and that not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 25 is contained in this roote, as are alſo all other numbers leſſe then 25, but becauſe 25 is the greateſt number of unities of the ſame denomination with the number 666, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108880:46"/> in this roote. And that I may expreſſe this the more clearly I will make it plaine by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and becauſe there is only a threefold ambiguity incident to the expreſſion of ſuch rootes as have fractions, I will therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſame queſtion to be propoſed to three ſeverall men concerning the length of one ſide of an exactly ſquare figure containing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely 666 foote of ſquare meaſure.

The ſecond being asked how many foote in length one ſide of this figure muſt be, would perhaps ſay 26, becauſe the exact length is nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The firſt of theſe three anſwers is clearly and evidently true, for 25 is the greateſt number and the leaſt number, and the only number of feet by which that length can be expreſſed. The ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is clearly and evidently falſe, for if that length, which wanteth above two inches of 26 foote, had lacked but one inch or one ſmall

And as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

25 is in a double reſpect remarkable in the root of 666, (firſt, in that it is the onely Cardinall number of the prime or Cardinall unities: and ſecondly, in that it is the onely number of ordinall unities or fractions, by which that root can be by feweſt figures moſt exactly expreſſed) I doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that it is a certaine and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed truth, that this number twenty five is that fatall and unfortunate number of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt oppoſed to the number 12, and that in an higher nature, &amp; in a greater degree of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then 666 is oppoſed to 144, it being that very number which as it is moſt apparently and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably applicable to the City and Hierarchy of Antichriſt, ſo is it alſo chiefly intended by the number
666: although it pleaſed the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to ſeale it up in a myſtery, and as it were to lock it up in the cabinet of a greater number, untill that time came which God had appointed for mans reaſon to unlock this cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, by the key of computation, and ſo to take out this ſo long hidden number, by which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt is (as it ſhall be ſhewed) moſt evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108880:48"/> and miraculouſly deſcribed. For if this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber had been expreſſely named in this place to have been the number of the Beaſt, or if that myſticall Babylon, in which Antichriſt raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, had been meaſured in the Scriptures by this number 25, as the new
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is by the number 12, then there had been no myſtery at all contained in it; then it had been ſo plainely ſet downe, that Antichriſt would have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.

And (as I am perſwaded) for this Cauſe partly is the Church militant, in the 21 Chapter of the <hi>Revel:</hi> meaſured, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and deſcribed by theſe two numbers only 144 and 12, that there might be an expreſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the Scriptures not onely ſhewing in generall how the number 666, ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted; but alſo leading us (as it were) by the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108880:51"/> hand to thoſe particulars, in which the root of this number ought principally to be applyed. And although perhaps it were a ſufficient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and as much as ſome Readers would expect, and more then any Papiſt can confute, to heap together a greater number of particulars, in which this number 25 is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther applicable unto the Romaniſts, then it is to any other eſtate, Church, or ſect; or then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other number is to themſelves, and to their ſtate: yet this is farre ſhort of that moſt exact and exquiſite application, which ſeemeth chiefly to be intended by the Holy Ghoſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the frequent occurring of this number in things pertaining to the ſtate, and Religion of the Romaniſts (as ſhall be ſhewed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, after I have proved the firſt, and chiefe application) may well be an argument, that either ſome ſecret deſtiny, which is in it; or their affectation of it, hath made it more proper to them, and more common among them, then any other number. Yet, if it were applicable to them in no more, nor in no other particulars, but in thoſe only which are <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> to thoſe things, which are meaſured, numbred, or deſcribed by the number 12 in the 21 Chap. of the

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108880:52"/> ſufficient, not only for an evident deſcription, but for a remarkable, eſſentiall, and incommunicable definition as well of their City, as of their ſtate and Hierarchy. For what can be either ſaid, or imagined to be more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, or remarkable either to, or in any city then the figure of it, the circuit of the walls, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of it, the number of the Gates, the number of the Churches, the number of Tribes, Wards, or Pariſhes into which it was firſt divided? And concerning the forme of government (which is more properly a City, then the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ſtructures) what can be ſaid, or imagined, to be more eſſentiall to it, or remarkable in it: then the number, time, place, office, and in ſome ſort the very name alſo of thoſe perſons, who are the very Baſis and foundation of it, and the very hinges (as they themſelves confeſſe) on which their whole Hierarchy depends, and moves it ſelfe? As therefore the number 12 in the 21 Chap. of the <hi>Revel.</hi> is applied to the Church and Hierarchy thereof in ſuch things as are moſt eſſentiall to it, and in ſuch circumſtances, as are moſt apparently remarkable in it: ſo the number 25 in like manner muſt be applied to the Papacie, and Pſeudo-Hierarchy thereof, in ſuch things, as are moſt eſſentiall to it, and in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108880:52"/> ſuch circumſtances, as are moſt apparently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in it.</p>
               <p>And as the number 12 is in that chapter after ſuch an admirable and wonderfull manner applied to the ſpirituall
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that is to the Church and Hierarchy thereof, that the literall and materiall City, in which that Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Hierarchy was firſt eſtabliſhed, is alſo by the ſame number plainly meaſured, and manifeſtly deſcribed: ſo ought alſo the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25 to be in ſuch ſort applied to the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and ſpirituall Babylon; that the materiall City it ſelfe, in which that Pſeudo-apoſtolicall Hierarchy hath been long ſince eſtabliſhed, may be by the ſame number both truly mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, and evidently deſcribed.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND that only the firſt decreed, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed number of the Colledge of Cardinals is typed out unto us, and plainly foretold by the root of the Beaſt's num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: this is a farre more evident and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſcription of Antichriſt, then if any other number had been declared which ſhould at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other time have been applicable unto them. For (as it is uſually ſaid) <hi>ſcire,</hi> is, <hi>per cauſas cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcere,</hi> and as we cannot perfectly know any thing untill we know what were the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall cauſes and beginnings of it, ſo this order of Cardinals (which beareth now ſo much ſway in the Romiſh Church) and which is the very body and corporation of Antichriſt) may be then perfectly diſcerned, when we know what it was in it's firſt originall and beginning. And for this cauſe it is that the holy Ghoſt in the deſcription of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> uſeth chiefly ſuch numbers and meaſures as were
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108880:57"/> conſpicuous and remarkable in the firſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent foundation of Chriſtian Religion. For the wall of the new Hieruſalem is ſaid to have 12 foundations, not becauſe the number 12, either in reſpect of the Apoſtles themſelves, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſtian Biſhops themſelves (who are their lawfull ſucceſſours in ſo much of their authority as is neceſſary for the perpetuall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church) ſhould be, at all times following, actually exiſtent, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Church; but that by this one num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is the root &amp; <hi>Baſis</hi> of another num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, there might be an evident &amp; ſtrong alluſion not only to the number, but alſo to the nature, qualitie, and office of thoſe perſons, from whom, as from the Root, the Churches Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy doth originally proceed, upon whom it is fundamentally built, and in whom it was firſt apparently to be diſcerned. As therefore the number 12 is not applicable to the Hierarchy of the Church in reſpect of any one perpetuall and conſtant number of Perſons, which was alwaies to continue, ſo neither ought the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25 to be after this manner applicable to the Romiſh Hierarchy, but the true and exact ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, ought chiefly to be terminated in the diſcovery, not onely of the number, but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108880:57"/> alſo, of the nature, quality, &amp; office of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from whom their Pſeudo-hierarchy did originally proceed, upon whom it was funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally built, and in whom and with whom it was firſt apparently to be diſcerned. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore it may perhaps at the firſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion ſeeme requiſite, that according to this application which I am at, the number 25 ought to be the onely conſtant, ſetled, and perpetuall number of the Popes Cardinalls, or Apoſtles, which ſhould at all times during the time of Antichriſts continuance be actually applicable unto them; yet upon due conſideration it muſt be granted, that ſuch an application can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be warranted by the example of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite number, which is applicable to the firſt number of the Apoſtles only; nor be agreeable to the nature of this type, which aymes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a certaine number of unities, but alſo of ſuch unities as are the root and Baſis of other unities, which were to proceed from them, and to be built upon them; I ſay therefore, that it: muſt be granted that there is no neceſſity, nor any probability, that this number ought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be applied unto them, then in reſpect of that firſt decreed &amp; eſtabliſhed number, which was moſt conſpicuous, and remarkable, &amp; moſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108880:58"/> exactly applicable unto them, in, and at the firſt foundation of their Colledge, and in the firſt apparent and actuall inſtitution of their order. And that, not only the number of the 10 crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hornes mentioned in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> may be thus interpreted in reſpect of their firſt origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall onely; but that alſo the number of the Beaſt ought to have ſpeciall reference to the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtock and image of Antichriſt's Anti-Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, is a truth clearely diſcerned, and in general tearmes plainly expreſſed by a late learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the
<hi>Revelations,</hi> although he aimed not at the ſame particular application which I doe.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being now thus cleared and diſcuſſed in generall, concerning the time, the place, and the perſons which this number ought chiefly to characterize; and it being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Rome</hi> is anſwerable to <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and that the Cardinalls of <hi>Rome</hi> are thoſe perſons which may be fitly ſtiled Anti-Apoſtles in the Romiſh Hierarchy; and laſtly, that the time in which the root of the Beaſt's number ought to be applied to the <hi>Pſeudohierarchy</hi> of
<hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> muſt be in the firſt apparent and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able emerſion of his Hierarchy: that ſo it may be like and anſwerable to that very nick of

               <p>Notwithſtanding that there is great difference among Interpreters, what theſe 6 things are, which are hereſo expreſly numbred, &amp; deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and howthey ought to be applyed to the Church: yet their divers interpretations (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which every man aboundeth in his own ſenſe) are rather helps the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hinderances, for the right diſcerning and finding out of thoſe things, which in the Romiſh Hierarchy are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For which way ſoever theſe things are to be underſtood, and according to what poſſible probabilitie ſoever they may be interpreted, there are things in all ſenſes anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto them in the Romiſh <hi>Babylon.</hi> If theſe Gates be literally to be underſtood of the gates of the materiall city <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall gates of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto them. And for a full application, in this ſenſe, it ſhall be ſhewed, that as the gates of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> were 12 in number, ſo the gates of <hi>Rome</hi> were 25 in number.</p>
               <p>But if thoſe gates be alſo to be underſtood in a ſpirituall ſenſe, which without all queſtion is chiefly intended, and moſt exactly verified, then theſe gates muſt be underſtood to be the gates of the Church ſignified by <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Now
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108880:60"/> the gates of the Catholique Church (which is really and truly the Heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> may be ſaid to be 12 divers waies. Firſt, the Apoſtles themſelves may be ſaid to have been the 12 gates of the Church in reſpect of their faith and doctrine in generall, becauſe by their examples, and by the ſincerity and truth of their life and doctrine, all other Chriſtians have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the true Religion. And in this reſpect the Cardinals of <hi>Rome,</hi> who make themſelves an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Apoſtles, and whoſe originall number was
25, may be alſo ſaid to have beene the 25 gates of ſpirituall
<hi>Babylon;</hi> becauſe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and originally, by their policy and hypocriſy, in laying the firſt foundation of Poperie, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſts have been ſince perſwaded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to believe, and to embrace the Hereſies and ſuperſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, and in a more particular and proper ſenſe, there may be ſaid to have been 12 gates of the Church, becauſe the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments, &amp; eſpecially of Baptiſme (which is literally, and properly the gate of the celeſtiall <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>) was chiefly, &amp; original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<note n="a" place="margin">Although others did ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize in the Primitiue Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the 12 Apoſtles, yet they cannot be properly called the firſt gates of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe to whom this power was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Apoſtles, were firſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Apoſtles.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108880:60"/> ſenſe it ſhall be ſhewed, that as in the firſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent beginning of Chriſtianity, the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſme was originally committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 12 Apoſtles in the City of
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which is therefore truly called <hi>Mater, gremium, &amp; osti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um omnium Eccleſiarum,</hi> the mother, the wombe and the gate of all Churches; ſo in the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent beginning of Popery, the adminiſtration of Baptiſme was originally committed unto 25 Cardinals in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which city doth alſo ſtile her ſelfe
<hi>Mater, gremium, &amp; oſtium om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Eccleſiarum,</hi> the Mother, the wombe, and the gate of all Churches.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, theſe gates of the new <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> ſeem to have ſpeciall reference to thoſe materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Churches (or to thoſe places which were then anſwerable to our Churches) wherein the Apoſtles did uſually adminiſter the word &amp; Sacraments while they were in
<hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> for, as the Apoſtles are called gates, becauſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the word and Sacraments was performed by them, ſo Churches may be called gates, becauſe theſe functions were performed in them.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108880:62"/> gates of the Chriſtian Church vniverſall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it's firſt originall and beginning (which time is chiefly aymed at in this whole deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) are truly ſaid to be twelve. And this I take chiefly, to be that literall veritie, really and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exiſting in the primitive Church, to which the twelve Gates of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> have a plaine and evident alluſion.</p>
               <p>And this is farther cleared, becauſe it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Text, that theſe Gates had 12 Angells placed at them, and the names of the twelve Tribes written on them. For firſt concerning the Angels, it is evident in this book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> that the Miniſters of the Goſpell are called the Angels of thoſe Churches, which are committed unto them. If therefore theſe twelve gates be the firſt chriſtian Churches, then the 12 Angels may fitly be ſaid to be thoſe 12 Paſtors, to whom the charge of theſe twelve Churches was committed. For as touching Angels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, which are miniſtring ſpirits, it is certaine that the diſpenſation of the Goſpell, is not committed unto Angels, but unto men; and that men, and not Angels, have power, and are appointed to baptize, and to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that is, to admit in, and to caſt out of the Church, and to open, and ſhut the gates of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108880:62"/> heavenly <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> And for this cauſe it is plainly ſaid in the 2 chap. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> verſe 5. that <hi>God hath not unto Angells put in ſubjection the world to come;</hi> in which place the world to come, ſignifieth the renewed eſtate of the Church under the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning the 12 Tribes, if the Gates be the firſt
12 Churches, and the Angells the 12 firſt Paſtors, then queſtionleſſe theſe Tribes, are the 12 firſt Eccleſiaſticall diviſions, Titles, Iuriſdictions, or Pariſhes, into which the City and people of
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> in ſome ſort were, and ſhould in proceſſe of time haue been more perfectly divided, if that City had not been deſtroyed, nor the Paſſage of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell hindered. For it is to be conſidered, that this deſcription of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to thoſe times, by way of anticipation as it were, and rather in reſpect of that beauty and perfection, at which the primative Church then aymed, then in reſpect of that, unto which it had in thoſe times attained. Nevertheleſſe becauſe it is evident by the Scriptures, that there was ſo great a number of beleeving Chriſtians in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> at that time, that every Apoſtle might have had the charge of neare 500 ſoules, it cannot therefore with any probability be
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108880:63"/> imagined, but that they did diſtribute, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves, and thoſe beleevers, in as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and convenient order, as thoſe times would permitt, and according to ſuch Diviſions, as did not only reſemble, the 12 Tribes of the Jſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, (which were typicall predictions of the Apoſtles times) but were alſo exemplary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the like Eccleſiaſticall diviſions, namely, of Dioceſſes, and Pariſhes, which began im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Apoſtles times to be erected in other Cityes, and haue been ever ſince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church.</p>

For as anciently it was obſerved, that (the City being divided into many Regions) there were certaine Curators appointed to every Region, who being ſubjected vnder the authority of him, that was the chiefe governour of the City, were to performe ſuch things as pertained to the welfare of the Citizens.</hi> So <hi>Pope</hi> Silveſter, <hi>for the good, and for the more convenient government of the Church, deſtinated ſeverall Cardinalls to every ſeverall Region of the City.</hi> Theſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which by
<hi>Onuphrius</hi> and <hi>Moſconius</hi> are called <hi>Regions</hi> and
<hi>Pariſhes,</hi> are by other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters called by divers other names. Some call them <hi>Diocaeſes,</hi> ſome <hi>Juriſdictiones,</hi> ſome
<hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernationes,</hi> ſome <hi>Tituli,</hi> ſome <hi>Eccleſiae parocbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ales,</hi> ſome <hi>Curiae.</hi> By all which it is evident, that they were certaine locall diviſions of the City and people, having Churches or publicke places of meeting erected in them, (as the Gates were to the auncient Tribes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) &amp; a power of Juriſdiction &amp; government annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them: and being ſuch, it cannot be denied but that theſe titles are fitly anſwerable to thoſe Tribes of the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> into which the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108880:66"/> City and people of the literall
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> were anciently divided: and alſo unto thoſe Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall diviſions aboue mentioned, by which in the times of the Apoſtles, the Citizens of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> either were, or began to be, or ſhall yet be, or by the deſcription of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> are ſuppoſed to have been diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And it may be here obſerved, that theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles or pariſhes, into which the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was divided about the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and came in the places, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of thoſe 30 or 35 Tribes, into which <hi>Rome</hi> was anciently divided. For the Cardinalls, as they increaſed in power, and grew into credit, ſo being not content with that ſpirituall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Epiſcopall juriſdiction which they had in their <hi>Titles,</hi> they began by little and little, to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe upon the temporall dominion of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, untill they had ingroſſed all that authority unto themſelves, which either the <hi>Curiales Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> had over the Tribes in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Senatours in humane affaires.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108880:67"/> into which Rome Chriſtian was divided, may by the ſame reaſon be called Tribes: but it matters not by what name they are called, ſo long as they are fitly anſwerable, to thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Tribes of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> although called by another name, and changed to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther number.

               </p>
               <p>Jn the next place it is to be obſerved, that in every one of theſe Pariſhes, there was ſome publique place of meeting appointed, or ſome Church erected, for the adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; &amp; theſe places or Churches in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> are fitly anſwerable to thoſe Churches in the literall <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which were the firſt Gates of the ſpirituall <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> For as it is above declared, that every particular Church, may for divers reaſons be ſaid, to be a gate of the Church univerſall, but eſpecially in reſpect of the adminiſtration of baptiſme, which literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly is the Gate of the Church: ſo theſe Churches in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are named Baptiſmall Churches (as it is
<note n="a" place="margin">By D. Field</note> obſerved) becauſe in theſe only, Baptiſme was originally adminiſtred, are in this reſpect, as alſo in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, properly and exactly anſwerable to thoſe Gates of the Spirituall <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:108880:67"/> That there were ſuch Churches as theſe, and that to every one of theſe Churches there was at the firſt but one Prieſt appointed, as there was one Angell placed at every Gate of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> is evident by that which
<hi>Onuphrius</hi> hath written, and by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of divers other writers, whoſe words J ſhall have occaſion to ſet downe, when I come to ſpeake of the number of theſe Churches. But when theſe Pariſh Preiſts degenerated into Cardinalls, and were made a Colledge, and Corporation, exerciſing a new kind of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopall juriſdiction, in, and over theſe churches; then was the birth of Antichriſt, then did Antichriſt really, and truly, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and locally ſit, firſt in theſe chriſtian churches at <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence his pſeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-apoſtolicall Authority, hath been obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impoſed upon other churches. By which it is evident, that, as ſome interpreters doe make the <hi>Apostles</hi> themſelves, although in divers reſpects, to be the Gates, the Angells, and the foundations of the celeſtiall
<hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> ſo the Cardinalls in one reſpect may be ſaid to be the firſt Gates of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> becauſe at their firſt inſtitution, the adminiſtration of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, was committed unto them only: and in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108880:68"/> another reſpect they may be called Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Paſtors of the firſt pariſh chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in
<hi>Rome;</hi> and laſtly, they may be truly ſaid to have been the firſt Foundation ſtones, on which the Popiſh Hierarchie hath been ever ſince erected, as it is above more fully and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly declared. I doe not forget that ſome writers doe interpret theſe twelve Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be the twelve Articles of the Creed, but I paſſe over this interpretation in this place, not becauſe the Pope hath not a Creed conſiſting of twentie and five Articles anſwerable to thoſe of the Apoſtles, but becauſe I conceive the 12 Articles of the Creed, to be chiefly and directly aymed at, by the twelve manner of fruits grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the tree of life, as in the ſixth and laſt place ſhall be obſerved. And thus much in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of things ſometime actually exiſting in <hi>Rome,</hi> anſwerable to the Gates, Tribes, Angels, and Foundations, ſometime actually exiſting in the new
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and that, according to all ſenſes, which way ſoever they may with any probability be interpreted: concerning all which I doe oblige my ſelfe to prove, that there were 25 Gates in <hi>Rome</hi> according to the ſenſe literall, &amp; 25 Churches for Baptiſme according to the ſenſe ſpirituall, and 25 Paſtors placed at
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108880:68"/> theſe Churches, and 25 Cardinals ſitting and ruling in them, and 25 Titles, Tribes, or Pariſhes belonging to them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. 18.</hi> Of ſuch things as are anſwerable to the meaſure of 12000 furlongs, and the 12 manner of fruits growing on the tree of life. The concluſion of all that hath been ſaid concerning the Antithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of things in generall, as it is distinguiſhed from that Antitheſis of numbers which is next to be proved.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the next place it comes to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what that is in the City of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, which is anſwerable to the meaſure of 12 thouſand furlongs, by which, as it is above ſhewed, the true compaſſe of that City, in which Chriſt did firſt and chiefly erect his Church and Hierarchie, is truly, although myſtically declared. To which J anſwer that as the number 12, having thouſands of furlongs added unto it, is the trueſolid meaſure of an imaginarie Cube, whoſe compaſſe is equall to the compaſſe of the city <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> ſo the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25 having thouſands of furlongs added to it, is the true ſolid meaſure of that imaginary
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108880:69"/> Cube, whoſe compaſſe is equall to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the city of <hi>Rome.</hi> I will not here trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the reader with Arithmeticall computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; let thoſe that have underſtanding to extract the Roots of numbers, either believe me, or elſe finde out themſelves, what is the ſolid root of 25000, and they ſhall be then reſolved that a Cube of 25 thouſand Furlongs, is in compaſſe 116 furlongs, and above 3 quarters of a furlong, that is, 14 miles and an halfe, and almoſt halfe a quarter of a mile, which meaſure, how fitly it agreeth, with the circuit and compaſſe of the city of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall in it's place be evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now in the ſixth and laſt place to be conſidered, what is meant by the 12 man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Fruits growing on the tree of life, and what thoſe things are in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> anſwerable unto them. This tree of life in the midſt of the city, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the midſt of his Church: theſe 12 Fruits, are that food, by which Chriſtians live, and are nouriſhed up unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life; and that food by which Chriſtians live is Faith. For all juſt men live by Faith (as it is written) and by every word that proccedeth out of the mouth of God: but the Apoſtles creed is the only true faith, becauſe it is the materiall
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:108880:69"/> object of every Chriſtian man's faith, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſumme of the doctrine of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gathered out of the Scriptures, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all truthes neceſſary to be believed: and therefore whoſoever confeſſeth with his mouth, and believeth with his heart all the Articles of the creed, he doth truly eat of all thoſe fruits which grow on this tree of life. Now becauſe the creed of the Apoſtles, did ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally proceed from 12 perſons, &amp; doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally branch it ſelfe into 12 Articles, as it hath been long ſince actually divided: therefore J doubt not but that this is that particular truth really and actually exiſting in the Church, to which theſe 12 manner of Fruits have a ſpeciall and evident alluſion.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, J ſhall make it evident, that the Papiſts have added new Articles to the Apoſtles creed, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the number from 12 unto 25, For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take the councell of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelfe, to be the faith and doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that Creed which was compoſed and ſet forth by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, according to the doctrine decreed in that Councell; in either of theſe, the number 25 is as remarkably applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Romiſh faith,</hi> as the number 12 to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:108880:70"/> Apoſtles Creed: but J pitch chiefly upon that forme and profeſſion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, which Pope
<hi>Pius</hi> the fourth hath ſet forth according to that Councell, to be generally received by all men, or as the Bull it ſelfe witneſſeth, <hi>ut unius ejuſdem fidei profeſsio uniformiter ab omnibus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibeatur, unica<expan>

               <p>I ſay therefore, as the 12 Apoſtles after that Chriſtian religion began to be believed in the world, did aſſemble themſelves together, and compoſed a Creed, conſiſting of 12 Articles, for the preſervation of unity in matters of religion, and for the ſuppreſſing of hereſies: ſo the chiefe Prelats of the Popiſh Church, after their
<hi>Romiſh</hi> religion began to be received and believed in the world, did for the advancement of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, &amp; for the ſuppreſſing of that which they call hereſie, aſſemble themſelves together at the Councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> which Councell was begun by 25 Prelates, continued 25 Seſſions, and ended with the ſubſcription of 25 Popiſh Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops: and laſt of all (which is the thing J chiefly ayme at) the doctrine and faith decreed in this Councell, was afterwards by the Pope and his Cardinals, reduced to a ſet forme of words, ſo naturally branching themſelves into 25 Articles, that they cannot with any conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie be divided into any other number, as it ſhallbe declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:108880:71"/>I have now ſpoken in generall, of all thoſe ſix things to which the number 12 is applied in the deſcription of the new <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> and I have ſhewed that there were things actually exiſting in the city <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and in the Primitive Church, to which every one of theſe things hath an evident alluſion. And I have alſo ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there were, and are things actually exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the City, and in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwerable and oppoſite to every one of thoſe ſix things above mentioned; and that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all ſenſes, and interpretations, which may, with any probability, be put upon them. If I have ſpoken more, then needs concerning the oppoſition, or contrapoſition of <hi>Things</hi> in generall, I have therefore done it, becauſe I am fully perſwaded, that this deſcription of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> is not for this reaſon onely ſet downe in the Scriptures, that by it the true Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> might be deſcribed; but alſo, that the falſe Church of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> by way of <hi>Antitheſis,</hi> and oppoſition, might by the ſame deſcription (<hi>mutatis mutandis</hi>) be manifeſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. For there is not intended by this deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption an oppoſition of <hi>Numbers</hi> only, and not of thoſe things alſo, which are numbred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor an oppoſition of <hi>Things</hi> only, and not of thoſe

                  <hi>Numbers</hi> alſo, which are joyned with them, but a double <hi>Antitheſis</hi> and contrapoſition, both of
<hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Numbers:</hi> ſo that from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> we may make two ſeverall inferences concerning
<hi>Antichriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the one drawne from the conſideration of
<hi>Things</hi> oppoſite, the other from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
<hi>Numbers</hi> oppoſite. By the firſt, may be found out the
<hi>Genus:</hi> by the ſecond, the <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia,</hi> by which
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> may be defined. From the firſt conſideration it followeth, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ought to have ſuch things belonging to his ſtate and Hierarchy, as I have already proved to have been actually exiſting in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie:</hi> as namely, perſons anſwerable to the
<hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> a City anſwerable to <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> having certaine meaſures, and a certaine number of <hi>Gates, Churches, Paſtors, Pariſhes,</hi> profeſsing their faith and religion under a certain number of heads and Articles. But from the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, (which conſiſts in the application of that number, which is oppoſed to 12, unto all theſe things above mentioned) it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, not only that
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt have a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie anſwerable to
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> but preciſely, how many furlongs in compaſſe his City muſt be, how many Gates it muſt have about it: how
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108880:72"/> many chiefe Churches in it; into how many Pariſhes it was firſt divided: what the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall decreed number of theſe perſons muſt be, who muſt pretend themſelves to be the
<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and foundation of that <hi>Hierarchie</hi> which
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> was to erect in it. And laſtly, by this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may be concluded, into how many heads or Articles, the Faith and Religion of
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> actually ſhould, or conveniently might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>It remaineth now in the laſt place, that I make the truth of all theſe things to appeare by particular application, and that I make good, what I have above promiſed by ſhewing out of hiſtory, that the number 25, is as evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, in all theſe particulars above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to the City, State, and <hi>Hierarchie</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the number 12 is, in all like and anſwerable reſpects, to the Church of Chriſt and to the new <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>

<hi>Gentils,</hi> which came daily to be of the number of Chriſtians, and to bury the dead.

               <p>But of all other writers, <hi>Onuphrius Panvinius de praecipuis urbis Romae Baſilicis,</hi> ſetteth downe theſe things moſt fully, the effect of whoſe words is thus in briefe. That whereas original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was a ſmall uncertain number of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters at <hi>Rome,</hi> they were brought to a certaine number &amp; order by <hi>Cletus</hi> and <hi>Evariſtus, Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> firſt <hi>Cletus</hi> reduced the Presbyters of
<hi>Rome</hi> to the number 25; afterward <hi>Evariſtus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of Chriſt 100, appointed &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a ſeverall Pariſh to every one of thoſe Presbyters; which Pariſhes were afterwards inlarged, and had their bounds and limits more perfectly and more exactly preſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, by Pope <hi>Dionyſius</hi> about the yeare of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108880:76"/> Chriſt 260; after which time
<hi>Marcellus</hi> about the yeare of Chriſt 305, limited the number of thoſe Titles, which anciently were firſt given to the Presbyters by
<hi>Evariſtus,</hi> and did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree conſtitute that there ſhould be in
<hi>Rome</hi> 25, as it were ſo many Dioceſes for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Baptiſing of ſuch <hi>Gentils,</hi> as were daily converted to Chriſtian religion. And this is the ſumme of that which <hi>Onuphrius</hi> ſaith, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt number of Cardinall Titles, which were at one, and the ſame time inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and decreed. After the time of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> when the Church was freed from perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe Titles were increaſed by divers Popes, as the ſame Author writes, ſome adding one, and ſome another; but as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is not numbred among the twelve
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> becauſe he was not one of thoſe twelve, who were all at once, and at the ſame time firſt named, and choſen to be Apoſtles; ſo thoſe Titles and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, who were afterward added one after another, to this firſt eſtabliſhed and decreed number of 25 at one and the ſame time inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cannot, neither ought to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: becauſe the myſtery conſiſteth (as it is above clearely and evidently proved) in that number only, which was truly applicable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108880:76"/> unto them at the time of their firſt inſtitution, and actuall emerſion of their order.</p>
               <p>And this firſt number 25 may be yet farther proved by the teſtimony of <hi>Hieronymus Albanus,</hi> who maketh mention of 25 Cardinals created by <hi>Marcellus.</hi> Jt may be confirmed alſo by the teſtimony of
<hi>Platina</hi> who writeth to the ſame purpoſe in theſe words.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108880:77"/> eſtabliſhed and decreed, was 25. And from hence it followeth neceſſarily (as it is above declared) not only that the firſt originall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Cardinals was 25; but alſo, that at the firſt apparent foundation of Popery, the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable diviſion of the City and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> into <hi>Tribes, Wards, Pariſhes,</hi> or <hi>Dioceſes</hi> was 25, and that at the ſame time the firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Churches for the adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was 25 alſo. If it be true which <hi>Onuphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> writeth, that there were 25 Prieſts in
<hi>Rome</hi> before that there were 25 Pariſhes, and that there were 25 Pariſhes in <hi>Rome,</hi> before they were actually made 25 Cardinall Titles, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſſes by <hi>Marcellus;</hi> then it followeth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the order of Cardinals had been actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtituted before the time of <hi>Marcellus</hi> (as J believe it was not) yet their originall number would have been 25.

               <p>How long this firſt number of Cardinals &amp; Titles continued without alteration, it is not materiall to enquire.

               <p>Secondly, that there were 25 Titles, Pariſhes, Wards, Dioceſes, or other diviſions of perſons and places, belonging to theſe
25 Churches: which 25 Titles, are anſwerable to thoſe 12 Tribes of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>

And this
<hi>Romiſh
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108880:79"/> Hierarchie</hi> properly and eſſentially conſiſts of the Pope and Cardinals onely, who are a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinde of goverment from all that ever were before them, pretending themſelves to be the ſea Apoſtolique, and reſembling an ancient goverment of <hi>Rome,</hi> but being nothing elſe in the truth of their being, but a reall and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all emulation, and oppoſition of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> even in reſpect of that tranſcendencie of <hi>Authority,</hi> &amp; infallibilitie of

25; <hi>for plus uno verum eſſe non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, there can be but one truth;</hi> &amp; it is not probable that either of theſe Authors was ignorant, how many Gates <hi>Rome</hi> had in their own times. If there were 27 when <hi>Livy</hi> writ, &amp; but 24 when <hi>Plinie</hi> writ, then it is probable that in this <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> there were for ſome tyme but 25: but it is moſt likely, that as in all great Cities, there are Gates ſome of greater, and ſome of leſſer note, ſome publike, and ſome belonging to private houſes or Pallaces; and ſome ſo ambiguouſly placed and uſed, that it is hard and doubtfull to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108880:81"/> be determined, whether they are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Gates of the Citie, or not: ſo I ſay it is moſt likely that
<hi>Livie</hi> accounted 2 or 3 Gates of leſſer note, for Gates of the Citie, which <hi>Pliny</hi> thought fit rather to be left out as private paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but perhaps a third man, which had been to ſet downe his opinion concerning the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> in thoſe times, would have taken one of thoſe 3 Gates into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which <hi>Pliny</hi> left out, and have left out 2 of thoſe 3 Gates which <hi>Livie</hi> tooke in: and ſo do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing it is likely he might have ſpoken more true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then either of them. For when Authors of equall credit and eſtimation, are of different o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, it is more ſafe to goe betweene them both (if there be any
<hi>medium</hi>) then to joyne with either. But I confeſſe all this proveth but a probability at the moſt, that the number of the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> was 25. I am content therefore that <hi>Onuphryus</hi> that learned <hi>Roman Antiquary</hi> (who, and who only (as far as I know) hath written a peculiar Tract concerning the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi>) ſhall decide this Queſtion. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by thoſe words of <hi>Onuphryus</hi> which are laſt aboue recited, that he affirmeth the number of the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Pliny</hi> to have been 24 at the leaſt; but it is plaine that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108880:82"/> all thoſe, <hi>Porta Triumphalis</hi> is not num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and therefore <hi>Onuphrius</hi> preſently after, when he rehearſeth <hi>nominatim</hi> all thoſe 24 Gates above ſpoken of, addeth this Gate in the laſt place, as a Gate of the City, although not one of the former number number, ſaying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>Porta triumphalis extra numerum.</hi> And whereas afterwards he nameth two other Gates, which are
<hi>Porta feneſtralis Palatii,</hi> and <hi>Porta Stercoraria,</hi> he ſaith of the firſt, <hi>Porta fene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stralis Palatii, non urbis, ſed potius Palatii fuiſſe crediderim;</hi> and of the ſecond, <hi>Porta Stercoraria, non urbis ſed Capitolii:</hi> plainly excluding theſe two laſt Gates, from being of the number of the Gates of the City, and plainly adding <hi>Porta tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphalis</hi> to the former number, as one of the Gates of the City; as, not onely other authors doe account it, but

               <p>Theſe 25 Gates <hi>Onuphrius</hi> ſetteth down as ſuch as were altogether actually exiſting betweene the times of <hi>Pliny</hi> &amp;
<hi>Juſtinian,</hi> which doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well agree with that time in which
<hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> did erect 25 Cardinalſhips in <hi>Rome.</hi> There were anciently 7 other Gates, of which <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth, that they ceaſed to be before his time; and therefore they are mentioned by <hi>Onuphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> as ſuch, as cannot, nor ought not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with thoſe above named. But as touching theſe 25 Gates above ſpecified, it is not materiall to enquire how long their number continued,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108880:83"/> whether untill the time of
<hi>Juſtinian,</hi> or how long afterward. For, as thoſe that affirme the number of the Gates of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to have been 12, doe not mean that there were ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely at all times, but that there were ſo many at that time in which the City moſt flouriſhed, or that there were ſo many <hi>plus minus,</hi> ſo that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one time with another, and conſidering all things, there is no one number, by which the number of the Gates of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> can be more truly expreſſed, then by the number 12: ſo in like manner, it may be ſaid of the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> and of the number 25. For as the Gates of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> ſo is it certaine that the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially in theſe latter times, have been much altered and changed, which hath cauſed a great variety of opinions among many writers, as well concerning their names, as their number. But thus much may be obſerved, that although the new addition unto
<hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>urbs Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> hath brought 7 other Gates with it, yet ſome of the former decaying, the ſame number 25 may ſtill remaine, and ſo much is expreſly witneſſed by <hi>Severinus Binius</hi> in his firſt Tome of generall Councels, pag. 261. where, ſpeaking either of his own time, or of that time in which <hi>Georgius Braunius</hi> writ his
<hi>Theatrium
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108880:83"/> urbium orbis,</hi> he hath theſe words,
<hi>Portas ſubur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biorum &amp; urbis 24 fuiſſe refert</hi> Plinius, Livius
<hi>tamen 27. Nunc ſunt turres 365, portae 25 ſuper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſunt,</hi> that is, <hi>pliny</hi> relates that the Gates of the City and Suburbs were 24, yet
<hi>Livy</hi> ſaith 27, now there are 365 Turrets, and there remaine 25 Gates.</p>
               <p>Thus I have now ſhewed, that which way ſoever the 12 Gates of the new <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> are to be underſtood, whether literally for material gates properly ſo called, or ſpiritually for Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in which Baptiſme was adminiſtred, which are as properly Gates of the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall in a ſpirituall ſenſe, as the other are of the materiall City in the ſenſe literall. I ſay, which way ſoever theſe are to be underſtood, J have ſhewed that as there were 12 Gates of
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> ſo there were 25 of <hi>Rome.</hi> I may now therefore conclude in generall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the 4 firſt particulars above ſpecified, that in what ſenſe ſoever the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> may be ſaid to have had 12 Gates, twelve Tribes, twelve Angels, and twelve Apoſtles, who were the firſt remarkable foundations of the Church of Chriſt, and all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction: in the ſame ſenſe the Romiſh
<hi>Babylon</hi> may be ſaid to have had 25 <hi>Anti-gates, &amp; 25 Anti-tribes,</hi> and 25
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108880:84"/> 
                  <hi>Anti-angels,</hi> and 25
<hi>Anti-apoſtles,</hi> which were the firſt remarkable foundations of the
<hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall</hi> Tower of their Antichriſtian <hi>Hierarchy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Come now unto the ſixt and laſt point of application, which concerns the faith and doctrine profeſſed by <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the number of heads and Articles into which it is, or may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently divided: and to this purpoſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned the Councell of
<hi>Trent,</hi> (of which the acclamations above mentioned te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, ſaying; <hi>Haec est fides Beati Petri &amp; Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum: Haec est fides Patrum: Haec eſt fides Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxorum</hi>)
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108880:85"/> I have noted three things in which the number 25 is applicable unto it. Firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the number of Prelates there aſſembled in the firſt Seſſion, the Hiſtory of the Councell of <hi>Trent, lib. 2. pag.</hi> 130. plainly teſtifieth that the number of all the Prelates then, and there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, was 25. And although the number of Prelates was afterwards in other Seſsions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and continually altered, and changed; yet this firſt Seſsion was that which gave <hi>nomen &amp; eſle</hi> to the Councell, and therefore the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prelates aſſembled in this Seſſion is moſt remarkable, &amp; rather to be obſerved then in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, concerning the number of Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that the whole Councell is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 25 Seſſions, all editions of that Councell doe teſtifie, and the books themſelves will be as a thouſand witneſſes untill the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, it is witneſſed by the ſame books alſo, that the number of <hi>Popiſh Archbiſhops,</hi> which ſubſcribed to this Councell was 25, and although many other Biſhops and Legates, and Abbats, &amp; others ſubſcribed alſo, yet the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Archbiſhops is more remarkable then any of the reſt, becauſe, as Biſhops (who ought chiefly, if not only to have deciſive voices in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108880:86"/> Councells) are virtually and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, their whole ſubordinate Clergie: ſo they themſelves, eſpecially in the <hi>Romiſh Hierarchie,</hi> are virtually and repreſentatively contained in their Archbiſhops. It might be here, as I believe, truly added, that the number of all the <hi>Decrees</hi> of this Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> was alſo 25. (I meane of ſuch
<note n="a" place="margin">For the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Decrees which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne either the beginning, continuing, prorogueing, tranſlating, or ending of the Councell, or of any Seſſion, or which concern ſafe conducts, are matters of meere forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and are not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the Decrees of the Councell, nor were read when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as the laſt act of the Councell wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth.</note>
                  <hi>Decrees</hi> as concerne matters of faith &amp; reformation, which onely are to be accounted for the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the Councell, becauſe theſe only were read and confirmed in this Councel, as appeareth by the laſt words of the laſt Seſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) but becauſe it is hard to ſet downe any one certain number of them, and becauſe it is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved by that which is above ſaid, that the number 25 is more remarkable in this Councel then any one other number: therefore I paſſe now to that <hi>Creed</hi> and forme of profeſsion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, which was compoſed by <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth, according to the doctrine of the Councell of
<hi>Trent,</hi> by which <hi>Creed</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they have increaſed the number of the Articles of the faith from twelve unto twenty five, as by the <hi>Creed</hi> it ſelfe here written <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> out of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his <hi>Bull</hi> may evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>

               <p>The words which follow next in the <hi>Bull,</hi> which are theſe, <hi>Hanc veram Catholicam fidem, &amp;c.</hi> doe ſuppoſe and intimate that a perfect forme of the Catholike faith is premiſed and formerly declared; wherefore J ſuppoſe that it cannot be denied, either that this
<hi>Creed</hi> endeth in this place, or that it is not aptly and fitly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and diſtinguiſhed into 25 Articles. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the firſt part of this <hi>Creed,</hi> wherein we agree with the Papiſts, to be diſtributed into 12 Articles (as commonly it is, and as no man that is a Chriſtian will deny) J doe upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108880:88"/> appeale unto any man, whether this whole
<hi>Creed</hi> can with any tolerable conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie be diſtributed, either into a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Articles, without ſeparating ſuch things as are in themſelves united, or into a leſſer, without confounding ſuch things as are in themſelves to be diſtinguiſhed. If it be objected that the 12 Articles of the Chriſtian faith ought not to be accounted as part of Antichriſts <hi>Creed,</hi> and that this application would better fit Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, if that addition onely which he hath made unto the Apoſtles
<hi>Creed,</hi> either were, or conveniently might be divided into 25 Articles: J anſwer, that if Antichriſt had added 25 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles unto the Apoſtles
<hi>Creed;</hi> then the number of Articles contained in the profeſsion of his faith, would have been 37, and not 25. For it cannot be denied, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> doth openly profeſſe the 12 Articles of the Chriſtian faith, nor proved that Antichriſt ought not ſo to doe. But rather it is to be conſidered; that it is as great, if not greater impiety and preſumption, to adde new Articles to the Chriſtian faith, as wholy rejecting it, to erect another faith and religion. And that it more properly befits Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, to deny the Chriſtian faith <hi>ex conſequenti</hi> and indirectly, then to renounce the externall
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108880:89"/> profeſsion of it: for the mouth of Antichriſt ought to be as a fountaine ſending forth at the ſame place ſweet waters &amp; bitter, he is to have a forme of godlineſſe, but to deny the power thereof; he is to pretend himſelfe to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and to be built upon the true foundation of the Apoſtles; but he is alſo to overthrow this foundation upon which, in ſome ſort he is, and pretends himſelfe to be built, by ſuperinducing damnable doctrines,
<hi>exconſequenti</hi> and indire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly contradicting &amp; denying that faith which he doth externally profeſſe. The Divels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may make profeſsion of the Chriſtian faith, to the ſame end that Antichriſt doth, that is, to deceive by it: and it is probable that the Divels doe more certainly know and believe, the hiſtoricall truth of the <hi>Creed,</hi> then ſome <hi>Popes</hi> have done. And laſtly, the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot deny, but their imaginary Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt (who ſhall be of the Tribe of
<hi>Dan</hi> as they ſay) muſt believe, or at leaſt proſeſſe himſelfe to believe, ſo many of the Articles of the <hi>Creed,</hi> as the
<hi>Iewes</hi> now doe, or as may be evidently proved out of the old Teſtament. By all which things it is evident, that the externall profeſsion of the Chriſtian faith, can no way priviledge the <hi>Pope</hi> from being that great Antichriſt
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108880:89"/> which was to come into the world: but rather it may be truly ſaid, that this externall profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is
<hi>cauſaſine qua non,</hi> ſuch a thing as could not but concurre to his conſtitution. For as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme conſiſts of two parts, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an open, yet a fained and hypocriticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the truth; the other a ſecret and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, yet a reall and effectuall everſion of it: ſo this forme of the profeſsion of the faith above mentioned, conſiſting of 25 Articles, of which 12 belong to the firſt part, and 13 to the ſecond, may be fitly eſteemed a perfect ſumme and character of Antichriſtianiſme.</p>

But being the ſame root or number, doth
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108880:90"/> not only ſhew the firſt originall number of <hi>Cardinals</hi> or <hi>Anti-apostles,</hi> but doth alſo intimate that they are according to divers ſpirituall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the
<hi>Gates, Angells,</hi> and <hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Popes</hi> myſticall <hi>City, State,</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy;</hi> and doth alſo ſhew, how many furlongs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the City of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be; how many <hi>Gates</hi> it was to have about it; how many
<hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> for Baptiſme in it; how many <hi>Paſtors</hi> did firſt exerciſe Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction over it; into how many
<hi>Titles,</hi> or Pariſhes it was firſt divided, and unto how many heads and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles Chriſtian religion ſhould be there augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; being, I ſay, this one number 25, doth not in one, nor in two, nor in three onely, but in all theſe particulars, and in all ſenſes in every one of theſe particulars, truly and evidently, Num<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber, Meaſure, Deſcribe, and Characteriſe the <hi>City, State,</hi> and <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and that ſtate and City onely; ſo that it is not ſo fitly applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any other ſtate and City, no not in any one thing fitly anſwering any one of thoſe ſix particulars above mentioned: then how can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man deſire a more eſſentiall and exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Papacie, then the right applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this number 25, plainly exhibits to him, that doth fully underſtand it? or how can any
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108880:91"/> one which underſtandeth theſe things, juſtly ſay, that I have ſpoken hyperbolically, whereas I have above ſaid, that the City, State, and Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> is by this number 25 moſt evidently, and miraculouſly deſcribed?</p>
               <p>J have as yet applied the number 25 unto the Papacie, only in ſuch things as are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, anſwerable and oppoſite to ſuch things, as are mentioned in the deſcription of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> But as the number 12 is in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects beſides theſe, applicable to the true Church, and to ſuch things as pertaine unto it: So J am now to ſhew (as I have alſo above promiſed) that this number 25 is in many other things applicable to the <hi>Papacie,</hi> and to ſuch things as doe pertaine unto it. But firſt there are ſome obſervations concerning that part of the application which is already proved, which may in this place be interpoſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it may be obſerved, that although the root of the number 666, were applicable to the <hi>Papacie</hi> in no other things, ſaving only in theſe above proved. Yet theſe are ſufficient: becauſe by theſe the <hi>Papacie</hi> is evidently diſtinguiſhed from all other ſtates of goverment: and becauſe there are no other things in the
<hi>Papacy</hi> more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall and remarkable then theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:108880:91"/>Secondly, that although the deſcription of the new <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> were of a City in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects meerely imaginary (as perhaps in ſome things it is,) and were not applicable either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a ſenſe of alluſion, to that materiall
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> which once was, or according to a ſenſe of prediction, to the laſt ſtate of the new materiall <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which for all that we know, may be yet for to come: yet ſuch an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary City, being ſo exactly, and in ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects meaſured, numbred, and deſcribed by the root and figure of one number onely, may be purpoſely ſet downe, as a rule and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, by which the root and figure of another number given, ought to be applied, to a City, not imaginary, but really and actually exiſting: for God, who ſometimes chuſeth things that are not, to bring to nought things that are, may alſo by things that are not, bring to light things that are; and by the oppoſition or juxta-poſition of ſuppoſed and imaginary meaſures &amp; num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a heavenly
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> may diſcover the true and reall numbers, and meaſures of all things remarkable in the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may be obſerved, that although the deſcription of the new <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> had not exemplarily directed this application chiefly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:108880:92"/> unto thoſe particulars above mentioned, yet the things themſelves are ſuch, that it is probable that the wiſdome of God would rather have foretold thoſe things of Antichriſt then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For God by his Prophets in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, intending to fore ſhew and foretell the kingdome of Chriſt, did not foretel what nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the letters of Chriſts name, or any name of his Church or kingdome ſhould containe (as the Papiſts would make us believe S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth concerning Antichriſt) but did foretell by divers types, the number of
<hi>Chriſts Apoſtles,</hi> and their office and quality, as appeares by divers Types in the Scriptures, and eſpecially by the Type of the 12
<hi>Oxen</hi> under the braſen ſea, by which, not onely the number of the Apoſtles was foretold, but alſo their condition, as that the Sea of Grace, and Laver of regeneration ſhould by them be ſupported, and carried into all quarters of the world, and that they ſhould goe and baptize all nations, &amp;c. Since then the Cardinals of <hi>Rome</hi> are thoſe perſons in that
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Hierarchy,</hi> which are anſwerable to the Apoſtles, and thoſe to whom the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſme was originally moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably committed; it is therefore more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that their Number, Nature, and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be typed in the Scriptures, then any
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108880:92"/> other one thing concerning Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it may be obſerved concerning the compaſſe of the <hi>Area,</hi> or platforme of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and concerning the firſt number of Churches at once and the ſame time inſtituted, that they are things fatall and myſticall in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as <hi>Onuphrius Panvinius,</hi> concerning both theſe things, hath obſerved; of the firſt he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thus. <hi>Pomaerii autem urbis Romae terminos non ſine Augurum conſilio poni, mutari, ac reſtitui potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſeſatis conſtat innu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

12 is applied in divers places of the Scriptures. As the land of
<hi>Canaan</hi> was divided into 12 juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108880:93"/> and Diviſions, which were governed by the heads of the <hi>Tribes,</hi> and did perhaps type out that diviſion which

                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> fore-telleth, or that Eccleſiaſticall goverment which the 12 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did exerciſe, not onely over the City of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> as Paſtors, but alſo over the whole Country belonging to that City as the firſt Chriſtian Biſhops. So perhaps, the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in thoſe Kingdomes where conveniently he might, and in thoſe times when he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt power, hath alſo divided certain kingdoms, into 25 provinces or other diviſions, and hath placed 25 men of note and eminency in ſeverall Kingdomes who by their power could rule and governe others. There were heretofore 25 Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats in England, as <hi>Camden</hi> witneſſeth, which had voyces in the Parliament houſe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I could ſet down ſome other particulars to this purpoſe, concerning other Kingdoms, yet I chuſe rather to leave it to thoſe, who are better acquainted with the hiſtories of forraign nations; who, if ſuch obſervations ſhall be thought neceſſary, have better meanes and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to ſearch after them, then I can have. It ſhall be ſufficient for me, onely to touch brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon ſome common and obvious things in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:108880:94"/> which the number 25 is remarkablely applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Papiſts: rather to give an hint unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then that I doe conceive the number of thoſe particulars which I ſhall here ſet downe, to be ſo much as conſiderable in reſpect of thoſe, which may be found out hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place their affectation of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25, is remarkable in reſpect of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Monks, Friers, and ſinging Maſſe-Prieſts in divers of their Abbies, Priories, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, and other their ſocieties and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations: and becauſe there are no others in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergie more fitly anſwerable to thoſe ſingers mentioneed in the 25 chapter of the firſt book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> then theſe Monkes and Friers, therefore it is ſo much the more obſervable, that the number 25 ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in reſpect of theſe, as the number 12 appeares to be in that Chapter, in reſpect of thoſe. The book called <hi>Bibliotheca Cluniacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> in which are recited the Abbies, Priories, and Deaneries belonging to that Order, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that in all thoſe ſocieties, where there is any ſetled number of Monks and Friars, there is none ſo frequent, &amp; remarkable as the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25, as by theſe particulars gathered out of

               <p>Firſt, it may be objected concerning the root of the number
666, that the root is not preciſely 25, but a ſurd number between 25 and
26; and that therefore if in this myſtery the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 25 be chiefly aymed at, it is probable that the wiſdome of God would have led us to the finding out of this number 25, rather by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding us to count and extract the root of the number 625, then the number 666.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuppoſing the root to be 25 (as it is moſt certaine that it is) it may be objected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the number of the Colledge of the Cardinals at their firſt inſtitution, that their number was not 25 but 26, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:108880:101"/> numbreth himſelfe among the Cardinals, as he is <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, in his Apoſtleſhip.

               </p>
               <p>To the firſt objection it might be replied, that although the root of 666, may in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be a ſurd number; yet it is to have its denomination, not from any ſquare number exceeding the number given, but from the greateſt ſquare number contained in the number 666, as it is above ſaid, and as by thoſe that have written of this part of Arithmaticke is ſufficiently declared: yet if it be granted that roots of numbers may ſometimes have their denomination, as well from the next ſquare number exceeding the number given, as from the greateſt ſquare number contained in it: this doth rather confirme then prejudice the truth of this application, as it ſhall be anon declared.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond objection, it might be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as Chriſt was not numbred among the Apoſtles, nor properly was an Apoſtle, but was their Lord and Maſter, ſo the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends himſelfe to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icarius Chriſti,</hi> is not, nor can be numbred among the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> but is their Lord and Maſter: but yet, as the
<hi>Pope</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends himſelfe to be <hi>Succeſſor Petri,</hi> (and that as well in his Apoſtleſhip, as in the Vicarſhip of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108880:101"/> Chriſt) in this reſpect it is nothing prejudiciall to the application of the root of the number 666 to the Papacie, if it be granted that he may in ſome ſort be numbred among them. For howſoever I ſay that theſe two objections may be thus briefly anſwered, yet J chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by admitting ſomething to be true in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſhew how theſe two objections doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally anſwer each other. For indeed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe objections is a full anſwer to the other; they are like two earthen veſſels, of which if one be knocked againſt the other, both are diſſolved. All that can be concluded from the firſt obiection is, that howſoever the root of 666 be expreſly 25, that yet in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it may be ſaid to be 26, becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and in ſome caſes, although not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, roots of numbers may have their denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>à numero quadrato ſimpliciter proximo,</hi> from the next ſquare number, although it exceed, and be not contained in the number given. All that can be concluded from the ſecond obiection is, that howſoever the firſt expreſly decreed num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Cardinals was 25, yet if the <hi>Pope</hi> be numbred among them, as in ſome reſpect he may and ought to be, that then that number may in ſome reſpect be ſaid to have been 26, as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108880:102"/> therefore the firſt obiection proveth the root of 666 to be expreſly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>25, and yet in ſome reſpect 26. So the ſecond proveth the originall number of
<hi>Cardinals</hi> to have been 25, and yet in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect 26. from both therefore it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that there is a greater ſimilitude and likeneſſe between the root of 666, and the firſt number of that Colledge and Corporation which is Antichriſt, then by any of thoſe other things which are above ſaid could have been conceived or imagined. For if the number of the Beaſt had been ſaid to have been 625, the<note place="margin">Quòd Papa inter Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meratur, ſignúeſt pileus ex purpura qui in ſepulchro Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae pingi ſo. let Hieron. Manfredus de Cardinalibus cap. 9.</note> root of which number is ſo
25, that it can in no reſpect be ſaid to be 26. Then the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> might with probability have alleaged, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was numbred among the 12 Apoſtles, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> being his Succeſſor actually is and ought to be numbred among the Cardinals, &amp; that after the
<hi>Popes</hi> death to teſtifie that he was ſtill a Cardinall, it is one of the uſuall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies at the <hi>Popes</hi> funerall, that a Cardinals hat ſhould be painted upon his coffin: and that therefore the firſt originall number was 26, and not 25. Contrariwiſe, if the number of the Beaſt had been ſaid to have been 676, the root of which number is ſo 26, that it can in no reſpect be ſaid to be 25, then it would have been allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:108880:102"/> that the Pope is <hi>Vicarius Chriſti,</hi> and that as Chriſt was not numbred among the Apoſtles, ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to be numbred among the <hi>Cardinals:</hi> and that therefore the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed number by <hi>Marcellus</hi> was 25, and not 26: and againſt this objection J ſee not what could have been materially replied.</p>
               <p>But the wiſdome of God foreſeeing all theſe difficulties and ambiguities, and intending to declare exactly the true number of the firſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that Colledge of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> whereof the
<hi>Pope</hi> is head, and knowing that it could not be foretold abſolutely without ambiguity, by one number onely (becauſe it is abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſay truly, that that number was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in all reſpects 25, or that it was abſolutely in all reſpects 26, for as the
<hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Vicarius Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> ſo it was 25 and not 26. But as he is <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Petri,</hi> and as he is numbred among the
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> ſo it is 26 and not 25.) doth therefore ſet downe this number 666, that by our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and extracting the root of this number he might lead us unto theſe two numbers the number 25, and the number 26, the laſt unities of both which numbers, are as two indiviſible extreames and limits, without and beyond which, this number of Antichriſts foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:108880:103"/> is not found, and between which, the very am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity of this numbers termination is in ſuch an admirable manner contained and confined, that although it may in divers reſpects be ſaid to be either of them; yet it can in no reſpect be ſaid either to be any other number
<note n="*" place="margin">without, that is <hi>extra,</hi> not
<hi>ſine.</hi>
                  </note> without, or beyond them: or to be ſo between them, that it may be ſaid to be neither of them. For as the root of 666 cannot be ſaid to be any number which is greater then 26, nor to be any number which is leſſe then 25, ſo neither can it be truly ſaid, that it is neither 25; nor 26. But as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall number of the foundation of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was either 25, or 26, which way ſoever it be underſtood: ſo the root of 666 (conſidered as an abſolute number in <hi>nudis eſſentialibus,</hi> as it ought to be) is one of theſe two numbers, take it which way you will. For if this number 666, be conſidered as it is an abſolute number in it ſelfe, and as it is <hi>quantitas diſcreta</hi> onely, then the root of this number cannot at all be ſaid to be between 25 and 26, either as
<hi>medium participatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> or as <hi>medium abnegationis.</hi> Not as
<hi>medium ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negationis,</hi> becauſe it may be ſaid to be either, &amp; in divers reſpects (although not by equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſpeech) to be both of the extreames: not as <hi>medium participationis,</hi> becauſe in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:108880:103"/> numbers, unities immediatly ſucceeding each other, doe admit no latitude, either of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, or denomination between them; and becauſe all unities in abſolute numbers are
<hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter &amp; abſolutè indiviſibiles,</hi> that is, ſuch as cannot be divided into parts, either of the ſame, or of any other denomination. Wherefore as it is abſurd and impoſſible, to ſay that the number of Cardinals at the firſt foundation of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was 25 Cardinals and halfe a Cardinall; or 25 Cardinals and three quarters of a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: ſo is it as unproper and unpoſsible to ſay that the root of
666 (being conſidered in <hi>puris eſſentialibus,</hi> and as an abſolute number) is 25 unities and halfe an unitie, or 25 unities &amp; three quarters of an unitie. But as the root of this number is properly and expreſly 25, and yet in ſome reſpect 26: ſo the number of Cardinals was properly and expreſly 25, as it is above pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and yet if the
<hi>Pope</hi> be numbred among them, it may in that reſpect be ſaid to be
26. For becauſe ſuch a number was choſen and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the number of the Beaſt, as had a ſurd number for it's root, it is therefore certaine that the manner how the originall number of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals was terminated, is ambiguous, and ſuch as could not by one number onely be expreſſed.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108880:104"/> For the choice of ſuch a number as had a ſurd root, doth not make that which is certaine in it ſelfe, to be ambiguous unto us, but it makes the very ambiguity it ſelfe to be certaine, that is, it makes us certainly know, that although 25 ſhould be the onely expreſſe and firſt decreed number of Cardinals; yet that the
<hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe (howſoever he be <hi>Primus in ordine</hi> and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denomination) may, and muſt in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect be numbred among them, and may, and muſt in ſome reſpect be excluded from them. And being the <hi>Pope</hi> muſt be numbred among them, as he is <hi>Succeſſor Petri</hi> in his Apoſtleſhip, and muſt not be numbred among them, as he is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icarius Christi,</hi> or as he is <hi>Succeſſor Petri</hi> in his Vicarſhip of Chriſt, why may it not therefore be ſaid, that the Root of this number doth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, not onely the number of the Cardinals, but alſo, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould pretend himſelfe to be, both <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icarius Christi,</hi> and <hi>Succeſſor Petri.</hi> But however this may be, or ſeem to be too nice &amp; intricate, yet I am perſwaded that thoſe few which fully underſtand what the ſurd root of a number is, and how it ought to be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, cannot but confeſſe that here is a ſtrange &amp; extraordinary ſimilitude, between the

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Reaſon may be yet farther demanded, why of all thoſe numbers which are between 650 and 676, there was no other number expreſſed to be the number of the Beaſt, but onely the number 666, to which I anſwer, that as it was moſt convenient for the reaſons above alleaged, that the number of the Beaſt ſhould be between thoſe two numbers; ſo there may be many reaſons here alleaged, why the number 666 was choſen rather then any other. Firſt, it may be ſaid that no other number whoſe root was 25, could be expreſſed by the numerall letters of the Beaſts name, as concerning the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:108880:105"/> names of this Beaſt, in divers languages hath been, and may be obſerved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be ſaid that the number 666 was choſen rather then any other number, whoſe root was 25, that by the two laſt figures of this number, or by the number ſignified by the two laſt figures of this number, there might be an alluſion to that image mentioned <hi>Dan. cap</hi> 3. whoſe height was 60 Cubits, and the breadth 6 Cubits. Which Image as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Forbs</hi> doth not without probability intimate, may very fitly ſhadow forth the Papacie. For as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations, Tongues, and Languages were allured with all kindes of Muſick, and inforced by the fierie furnace, to fall down and worſhip that Image: ſo divers nations and languages have been both allured by the muſick of all kinds of flatteries and falſe doctrines, and alſo inforced by fierie Furnaces and other torments, to fall downe and worſhip that Idoll Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard at <hi>Rome.</hi> But as
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to his great aſtoniſhment, ſaw foure men walking in the midſt of the fire, inſteed of thoſe three which fell downe bound at the firſt: ſo the <hi>Pope</hi> to his terror may behold, that the number of Proteſtants increaſeth daily notwithſtanding his fierie perſecutions, and thoſe that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108880:106"/> lay dead for a time, in the ſtreet of the great City which ſpiritually is called <hi>Sodome</hi> and
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> doe now ſtand upon their feet againe in greater numbers, and cauſe feare to fall upon their enimies.</p>
               <p>But if neither of theſe reaſons, nor any thing yet ſaid, give ſatisfaction to iudicious readers, nor ſhew ſufficient cauſe why the number 666 ſhould be choſen rather then 625, or any other number whoſe root is 25; yet I am confident that that reaſon being added to it, which I ſhall now ſet downe in the laſt place concerning the figure of the number 666, cannot but give full ſatisfaction to all ſuch as underſtand it. For as the root of 144 is oppoſed to the root of 666, ſo alſo is the figure of that number oppoſed to the figure of this, and as the root of 666 exceeds the root of 144 by a double proportion and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, ſo the figure of 666, exceeds the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the number 144, by a double proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſomewhat more. And as divers myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have been already found out, by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the root of the number 666, to ſuch things as pertaine to the Papacie: ſo there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſome myſteries to be found out, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the figure of the ſame number to the City of
<hi>Rome.</hi> For as the actuall application
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108880:106"/> of that number which is the root of 144, to ſuch things as are mentioned in the deſcription of the new
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> doth guide, and direct, and as it were confine the application of that number which is the root of 666, to ſuch things as are anſwerable and oppoſite unto them: ſo the actuall application of that figure which is the figure of the number 144, to that new

                  <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> deſcribed in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is both an example and a warrant, ſhewing how that figure which is the figure of the number 666, ought to be applied to that City which is anſwerable and oppoſite to
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> If therefore a reaſon be yet demanded, why the number
666 ought to be choſen to be the Beaſts number, rather then any other whoſe root was 25. I anſwer, that for what reaſon ſoever the number 144 was choſen rather then any other number, whoſe root was 12; for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was the number 666 choſen, rather then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other number, whoſe root was 25. But no better reaſon can be given or imagined, why the number
144 ſhould be choſen rather then 145, or 146, or 154, or any other number, whoſe root is 12, but onely becauſe the figure of this number, is a perfect figure perfectly repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the figure of the City <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108880:107"/> it may be concluded, that no better reaſon ought to be expected, why
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>66 ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen rather then any other number whoſe root was 25, but only becauſe the figure of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, doth perfectly repreſent the figure of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of
<hi>Rome.</hi> Now therefore that the truth of this may appeare, I muſt briefly expreſſe what figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated numbers are.</p>
               <p>The ſumme of that which <hi>Euclide</hi> &amp; others have written <hi>de numeris planis figuratis,</hi> that is, of flat ſuperficiall figurated numbers, is, that thoſe numbers onely are figurated numbers, which can be produced and made, either by the multiplication of one number by it ſelfe, or by the multiplication of ſome one number by another number: as for example, the number 12 is a figurated number, becauſe it may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced &amp; made by the multiplication of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 3 by the number 4, and alſo by the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the number 2 by the number 6, as by the following figures, wherein 12 unities are placed according right angles, and equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, may plainly appeare.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:108880:107"/> But the number 13 or 11 can by no meanes be reduced to any
<note n="*" place="margin">That is, to any quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular figure ſtraight lines and rectangles either of equal or unequall ſides.</note> figure, wherefore they are not figurated numbers, neither can ſo many unities be placed any manner of way, but ſtill there will be ſomething wanting to make the ſquare figure compleat, or ſomething redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant which doth exceed it; as theſe examples ſhew.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The number 30 is a figurated number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108880:108"/> three times ten, or five times ſix make this number, as theſe examples ſhew.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>And by theſe examples it may be obſerved, that the ſame number may have divers figures. And when it ſo falleth out that the ſame number may be varied into divers figures, then that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which commeth neareſt unto the equila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall ſquare figure is the moſt perfect figure. For, <hi>Quadratum aequalium laterum</hi> is <hi>perfectiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum in ſuo genere,</hi> and the equilaterall ſquare fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is <hi>capaciſsima figura,</hi> the moſt capacious fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, of all Iſoperimentrall figures conſiſting of 4 ſtraight lines. But <hi>Quadratum oblongum,</hi> that is, ſuch a figure as is longer one way then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a figure which is more or leſſe perfect, either as it approacheth neerer, or as it is farther diſtant from the perfect ſquare of equall ſides. Now when the figure of any given number is ſought after, that is ſtill to be accounted the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that number, which either is a perfect
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108880:108"/> ſquare, or neereſt unto it. For when the ſame number is capable of divers figures, the rule is, <hi>Denominatio ſit à praeſtantiori,</hi> that is, the moſt perfect figure is to give denomination to the number. As for example the number 144. may be made either by multiplying 12 by 12, or 9 by 16, as theſe examples doe ſhew.</p>
               <figure/>
               <figure/>
               <p>Yet this number is named a perfect ſquare number of equall ſides, from the more perfect figure, and not from the other; and this, and not the other, ſheweth the true figure of the City <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then that the true figure of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> City may be found out, let us ſeek after the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the number 666: for the moſt perfect fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure that this number is capable of, is as exactly applicable to
<hi>Rome,</hi> as the moſt perfect figure of the oppoſite number is to
<hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> The nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way that J know to finde whether any number given, be a figurated number or not, &amp; to finde what is the moſt perfect figure of it, is to divide the number given by its own root, &amp; ſeverally by all ſuch numbers as are leſſe then it, if after the performance of every ſeverall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108880:109"/> there doe ſome fractions remaine, then is the number given no figurated number; but ſo many times as there doe no fractions remaine, of ſo many ſeverall figures is that number cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, of all which figures, that which either is the equiliterall ſquare, or elſe that which is heareſt unto it, is the moſt perfect figure which is ſought after. I divide therefore the number 666 by 25, the quotient is 26, and the fractions are 16 / 25 ſo that it doth not yet appeare to be a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurated number, but by this firſt computation it appeareth to be no perfect ſquare number of equall ſides, as 144 is; and therefore by this firſt diviſion it may be concluded negatively, that the City of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is not of an equilaterall ſquare fiigure as <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was. In the next place I take away one unitie from the number 25, and I doe againe divide the number 666 by the number 24, the quotient is 27, and the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions remaining and becauſe there be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions remaining, it doth not yet appeare to be a figurated number, in the next place J divide the number 666 by 23, the quotient is 28, the fractions remaining are 22 / 23. In like manner if the number 666 be divided by 22, the fractions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining are 6 / 22. If by 21, the fractions are
15 / <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. If by 20, the fractions are 6 / 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. If by
19, the fraction is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108880:110"/> one unitie, but if it be divided by 18, the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is 37, and no fraction remaineth; by this therefore it may be concluded that 18 being multiplied by 37, the product muſt be 666, and therefore this number is a figurated number, and that the moſt perfect figure of it is, <hi>Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>

For becauſe the length of this <hi>Area</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the breadth, therefore two ſolid fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures ariſe from their ſeverall meaſures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> in which the length and breadth are all one, there can but one ſolid figure be produced. Now becauſe theſe two ſolid figures (of which one is equall in height to the breadth of the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other equall in height to the length of the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) cannot be both of them truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the meaſures of <hi>Rome</hi> at the ſame time, and becauſe no reaſon can be given, why one ſhould be taken rather then the other (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both derived, preciſely after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the figure and meaſures of the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) as the oppoſite ſolid figure is from the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Therefore they muſt both of them truly expreſſe the meaſures of the City of
<hi>Rome,</hi> but at divers times. The firſt figure in which the height of this imaginarie City is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:108880:113"/> to the breadth of the <hi>Area,</hi> ſheweth the meaſures of the <hi>Area</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> at that time in which Antichriſt began firſt to lift up himſelfe and to beare ſway in it. The ſecond figure, in which the height of this imaginary City is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed from being equall to the breadth of the <hi>Area</hi> to be equall to the length of it, ſhewes the meaſures of the <hi>Area</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> at that time when the pride of Antichriſt ſhall be at the higheſt, and when his Kingdome ſhall begin to be top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavie, and to threaten a downefall both to it ſelfe, and to thoſe that depend upon it. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore deſires to know how many furlongs in compaſſe

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe things are darke and intricate, and thoſe which have not (and many which have) a competent knowledge in Geometry cannot yet readily finde out the perimeter of a ſolid fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure having only the ſolid content &amp; proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole figure given, but none of the lineall meaſures, therefore ſuch as would have the truth of theſe things made plaine and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, even to their ſenſes, may conſider, that it is a true rule, <hi>vt pondus ponderi, ita Solidum ſolido,</hi> that is, As weight to weight, ſo is ſolid mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſolid meaſure. If therefore one ounce of ſoft wax, or clay, or any other Homogeniall
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:108880:114"/> ſubſtance be taken, and be moulded and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned according to the figure of a Cube, whoſe length breadth and height are equall, and be ſuppoſed to repreſent 1000 ſolid furlongs; then the length of one of the ſides of this little Cube, being divided into
10 parts, every one of thoſe parts do repreſent the true length of one furlong. (for 1000 is a perfect and exact Cubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call number, whoſe Cubicall root is 10.) Let there be therefore a ſcale made or a line divided, containing 100 or 200 of thoſe parts or diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And a line being thus divided let there be another peece of the ſame wax taken, being in weight preciſely twelve times as much as the former, if the former litle Cube were one ounce in weight, then let this be juſt 12 ounces, and let it be made and faſhioned according to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a Cube. Then let the compaſſe or peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of this greater Cube be meaſured by thoſe diviſions of the litle Cube, or by the ſcale above mentioned, and the perimeter of it will appeare to our ſenſes, and will be found to be 91 of thoſe diviſions, &amp; ſome fractions remaining; as it is above ſhewed, that the meaſure of the compaſſe of the new <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is 91 furlongs and ſome odde paces. Then let there be another peece of the ſame wax taken, being 25 ounces
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108880:114"/> in weight, and let it be made into a Cubicall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure alſo. And let the compaſſe of this be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the ſame diviſions above mentioned, and it will be found to be 116 of thoſe diviſions and ſome fractions remaining. Then let the ſame Cube or another peece of the ſame wax equall in weight unto it, be moulded into an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſolid rectangular figure having 4 equall ſides, the length exceeding the breadth or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by a double proportion and ſomewhat more, as 37 is to 18, ſo that it may be like in its proportions, to the firſt of the two figures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned, in which the height is equall to the breadth of the
<hi>Area:</hi> and then let the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimeter of the <hi>Baſis</hi> or
<hi>Area</hi> of this figure be meaſured by thoſe diviſions of the litle Cube firſt mentioned, and it will be found to be above 140 furlongs as is above ſaid. Laſtly let the ſame peece of wax or another equal in weight unto it be transformed into the figure and proportions of the ſecond figure above mentioned, in which the height is equall to the length of the
<hi>Area</hi> of the ſame figure: and then let the perimeter of the
<hi>Baſis</hi> or <hi>Area</hi> be meaſured by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the ſcale and litle Cube firſt made, &amp; the perimeter will be found to be, about 110 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108880:115"/> as is above ſaid. And by this means J ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, thoſe that have litle, or no inſight in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, may underſtand and ſee, how the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the new <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is myſtically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the meaſures of a ſolid Cubicall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in the 21 Chap. of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> and may alſo conceive how the divers meaſures of the myſticall <hi>Babylon</hi> or new <hi>Rome,</hi> may be,
<hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> analogically deduced from them.</p>
               <p>If it be objected againſt that which J have above ſaid concerning the ſolid meaſure of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and conſequently againſt all that I have above ſaid of the meaſures of
<hi>Rome;</hi> that according to ſome Copies and Editions, the words in the text are not, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. that is, not twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but (as ſome interpret it) twelve times twelve thouſand. J anſwer firſt, that that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which I have followed, is moſt generally and commonly received. Secondly, that theſe words
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doe more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more probably ſignify twelve thouſand and twelve which cauſeth no conſiderable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the meaſures) then twelve times twelve thouſand. For if that number had been intended, then it ſhould have been ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or rather
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108880:115"/> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Laſtly, ſuppoſing both theſe divers readings of this text were equally probable, yet being the meaſure of 12000 furlongs, doth agree with the meaſures of the ſame City ſet down by <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel,</hi> and the meaſure of twelve times twelve thouſand cannot agree with them, therefore that is the true reading, and not this. For by what meanes can we better interpret a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ambiguous place of Scripture, then by comparing it with another place of Scripture, which is cleare and out of queſtion.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that 12000 furlongs cannot be the exact meaſure of the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the new
<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> is an exact Cubicall figure, but 12000 is not an exact Cubicall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I anſwer, that howſoever ſome Authors which doe write of theſe meaſures, doe ſeem to imply ſome ſuch objection, concerning the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid meaſure; and <hi>Lira</hi> concerning the ſquare meaſure of the <hi>Area</hi> of this City, where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to apply this number 12000 unto it; yet there is no reality in this objection. For, that 12000, or any other number, which is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cubicall number, or a perfect ſquare num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, may yet be the exact ſolid meaſure of a Cube; and may exactly expreſſe the ſuperficiall
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:108880:116"/> meaſure of an exactly ſquare figure, is a certain and undoubted truth which cannot be denied, although perhaps ſome men doe not ſuddenly and eaſily conceive it.</p>
               <p>J have now, as J hope, ſufficiently anſwered all ſuch objections, as J doe yet know, can be materially objected againſt the ſubſtance of that which I have above written. And I am willing to publiſh theſe things (notwithſtanding I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but diſcover much ignorance and weaknes with them) that J may know what more can be objected againſt them. Wherefore J do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and earneſtly deſire, thoſe religious, wiſe, &amp; learned men, which doe not yet believe that the Pope is
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> nor that this is the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of his number, that they would not conceive their own apprehenſions, which ſeem to make againſt theſe poſitions, ſo paraeneticall, as if nothing but vaine jangling, could be repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them. Let them publiſh them to the world, that Truth may be diſcovered, errors confuted, the Church inlightned,
<hi>Antichriſt</hi> revealed, and God glorified. They may perhaps receive ſatisfaction beyond their expectation, if not from me, yet from thoſe who are better able to defend ſo much truth as I have written then I my ſelfe can be. As for <hi>Romiſh Catholiques,</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:108880:116"/> eſpecially ſuch as are ſeducers of others, &amp; ſuch as are truly Italionated, J doe well know that no evidence of truth is ſufficient to convince them; and that although a man ſhould bray them in a morter with a peſtle, yet would they not ceaſe to gain-ſay thoſe truths, which they are not able to confute. But for thoſe of their laitie, who out of ignorance and ſimplicity are ſeduced by them (of which there are many in this Kingdome) I doe rather pray for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, then deſire their confuſion, and that God would vouchſafe to open their eyes, that they may wonder at themſelves, for having been ſo long deceived by thoſe hypocrites at <hi>Rome;</hi> who are that very Synagogue of Sathan, and that corporation of falſe Prophets, in whom dwelleth bodily, the fulneſſe of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the fulneſſe of that ſpirit of error, which was to come into the world. For the farther manifeſtation of which truth, if it hath pleaſed God to diſcover any thing by me; it is, becauſe he is ſometimes pleaſed to ſhew his ſtrength in weakneſſe, and to chuſe things that are weake, and things that are deſpiſed, to bring to nought things that are mighty. To him therefore, who is the onely wiſe God, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108880:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> who will in due time diſcover all neceſſary truths to his Church, be all Glory and Praiſe for ever. AMEN.</p>
